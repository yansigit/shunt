//! End-to-end coverage of the Antigravity adapter's *process* path.
//!
//! `tests/antigravity_translate.rs` covers the pure pieces — prompt building,
//! event translation, workspace resolution. Nothing covered the part that
//! spawns `agy` and pumps its stdout, which is where both of this branch's
//! review findings lived: a per-line timeout that never bounded the turn, and
//! a terminal path that reaped a child it had not killed.
//!
//! `find_agy_binary()` checks `AGY_BIN` first, so a stub script standing in for
//! the CLI drives the real adapter without the real Antigravity install.
//!
//! **This must stay its own test target.** `find_agy_binary()` memoizes in a
//! `OnceLock`, and `antigravity_translate.rs` already sets `AGY_BIN` to a temp
//! path *and then deletes it*. Sharing that process would leave this file
//! spawning a binary that no longer exists. A separate `tests/` file is a
//! separate binary, hence a separate process and a fresh `OnceLock`.
