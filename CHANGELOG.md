## [0.38.0](https://github.com/pleaseai/shunt/compare/v0.37.0...v0.38.0) (2026-08-25)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **auth:** a shared slot holding a shunt credential in any position is now removed entirely, so a genuine upstream credential sharing that slot is dropped with it. Only affects callers who send `authorization` or `x-api-key` more than once in a single request. The surgical alternative — rebuilding the slot from its surviving values — adds a second place deciding which values are shunt's, which is the drift `auth::slots` exists to remove.
* **antigravity:** `kind = "antigravity"` is now the native HTTP upstream, and the local `agy` subprocess transport moves to `kind = "antigravity_cli"` (built-in provider `antigravity-cli`), which is deprecated. A config still carrying the old meaning is refused by name rather than retargeted, and a routed `antigravity` provider with no credential refuses to start — switching transport, credentials, and egress underneath a green startup would be worse than failing.

## [0.28.0](https://github.com/pleaseai/shunt/compare/v0.27.0...v0.28.0) (2026-07-29)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

## [0.27.0](https://github.com/pleaseai/shunt/compare/v0.26.1...v0.27.0) (2026-07-29)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **proxy:** `adapters::Adapter` is now `pub(crate)`. `Adapter::forward` takes the crate-private `RequestBody` instead of `Vec<u8>`, which forces the trait itself to be crate-private. External crates can no longer name or implement it. Practical impact is nil — adapter dispatch is static and in-crate, with no `dyn Adapter` and no public registration hook, so an external implementation could never have been invoked.

### Performance Improvements

* **proxy:** parse the inbound request body once across the hot path ([#261](https://github.com/pleaseai/shunt/issues/261)) ([ca37b70](https://github.com/pleaseai/shunt/commit/ca37b704aa8cfb511880853312f65b8161ee2c75))
