# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-09-06 after v1 milestone completion)

**Core value:** Protocol-faithful, streaming-safe client behavior in a bounded, lean gateway.

## Current Position

Phase: 9 of 16 (Provider Conformance Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 4
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-09-06 — Completed 09-01 shared redispatch commitment

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Port observable OpenCodex behavior and fixtures, not its platform architecture.
- Phase 1 changes only the opt-in inbound Responses transport; HTTP stays stable.
- Phase 2 provider-semantics work requires explicit user approval.
- [Phase 02]: WebSocket live turns refresh the runtime snapshot at turn start so each turn keeps one immutable native route while later turns observe reloads.
- [Phase 02]: All maintained locales state exact compatible native selection, pinned fallback, pre-dispatch rejection, and no post-output hop consistently.
- [Phase 02]: Missing or malformed models retain pinned compatibility routing; only unique exact compatible declarations select a native provider.
- [Phase 03]: Hard quota requires bounded exact structured evidence; status-only and ambiguous failures stay transient.
- [Phase 03]: Retry-After parsing is centralized, strictly bounded, and supports decimal seconds plus HTTP dates.
- [Phase 03]: Quota inspection is capped by bytes and total time while preserving the downstream response stream.
- [Phase 04]: Native compaction is HTTP-only, byte-faithful, and shares the existing inbound Responses account/auth path.
- [Phase 04]: Compact capability is limited to ChatGPT/Codex and the canonical OpenAI API; arbitrary compatible gateways fail closed.
- [Phase 05]: Only unique exact Anthropic mappings enter translation; native Responses routes remain byte-faithful and fallback inference stays pinned.
- [Phase 05]: Stateful or lossy Responses features fail before dispatch; HTTP and WebSocket share one bounded Anthropic response state machine.
- [Phase 05]: Anthropic transport remains authoritative for credentials, account selection, retries, admission, timeouts, and safe headers.
- [Phase 06]: Capability filtering never removes the primary and runs before fallback credentials or network access.
- [Phase 06]: Eligibility uses one internal provider matrix; no public configuration or provider semantics were added.
- [Phase 06]: The `[1m]` context marker removes every fallback because no later target can guarantee the requested context window.
- [Phase 07]: Collaboration translation is default-off and request-authorized; native Responses traffic remains opaque regardless of the flag.
- [Phase 07]: Exact Anthropic routes bridge declared V2 collaboration tools and plaintext tasks, but ciphertext-only or provider continuation state fails before dispatch.
- [Phase 07]: shunt performs no collaboration decryption, persistence, cache, or hidden billable recovery call.
- [Phase 08]: The first signal stops admission and starts one validated process deadline, defaulting to 30 seconds with an inclusive 1..=3600 range.
- [Phase 08]: Deadline expiry drops the Axum server future; normal Tokio runtime teardown cancels remaining HTTP, SSE, WebSocket, and background work and releases RAII-owned resources.
- [Phase 08]: The existing second-signal immediate-exit escape hatch remains available, while timeout changes require restart because the coordinator captures the value at boot.
- [Phase 09]: Commitment remains crate-private and additive to existing transport, status, safety, and retry-budget evidence.
- [Phase 09]: Every successful first Codex WebSocket event remains conservative commitment; structural tool events are replay-unsafe.
