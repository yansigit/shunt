# Ordered upstreams and cross-provider failover

Engineering spec for issue #218, implementing [ADR-0002](../.please/docs/decisions/0002-ordered-upstreams-failover.md).
Status: **implemented.** This document is the implementation contract; deviations
found during implementation are recorded in §6.

The reference Claude apps gateway's behavior cited throughout was extracted
from the shipped `claude` binary (2.1.215): the config schema (zod), the
per-upstream model mapping, and the failover loop. Where this spec says
"reference contract", shunt must match it observably.

## 1. Configuration schema

### 1.1 `[[upstreams]]` — ordered failover units

A new top-level array. Declaration order is the global failover precedence.
One entry is one failover unit: a named route with its own credential scope.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Unique, non-empty, non-whitespace. The identity used by `upstream_model` maps, `[[routes]] provider`, `server.default_provider`, metrics, and the admin surface. |
| `provider` | no | Built-in preset id (§1.2). Supplies defaults for `kind`, `base_url`, and `auth`; no preset overrides `count_tokens` (§1.2). |
| `kind` | if no preset | Adapter protocol (`anthropic`, `responses`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `antigravity`, `antigravity_cli`). No preset supplies `gemini`, `antigravity`, or `antigravity_cli` (§1.2), so an upstream on any of them must set `kind` explicitly. |
| `base_url` | if no preset | Upstream base URL. For `kind = "cursor"`, this is the login/token-refresh surface only; inference uses the fixed agent host `https://agentn.global.api5.cursor.sh`, overridable only with `SHUNT_CURSOR_AGENT_BASE_URL`. |
| `auth` | no | String or map (§1.3). Default: preset's default auth, else `passthrough`. |
| other provider fields | no | `effort`, `service_tier`, `count_tokens`, `websocket`, `tool_search`, `retry` — unchanged semantics, now per upstream, except that normalized `retry` settings do not apply to the Cursor streaming turn. |
| `workspace_roots`, `sandbox` | no | `kind = "antigravity_cli"` only; unchanged semantics and defaults (`[]` and `true`), now per upstream. `sandbox = false` is refused at startup when `server.bind` is non-loopback, and the adapter re-checks it per request against the listener bound at boot, so a reload cannot disable the sandbox under a public listener. |

Explicit fields always override preset-supplied values.

### 1.2 Provider presets

A static data table in code (table-driven per AGENTS.md; no per-provider
branching). Unknown preset name → config error listing available presets.

| preset | kind | base_url | default auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `anthropic` | anthropic | `https://api.anthropic.com` | `passthrough` |
| `codex` | responses | ChatGPT/Codex backend (current documented URL) | `chatgpt_oauth` |
| `openai` | responses | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `api_key`, env `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `xai` | responses | `https://api.x.ai/v1` | `api_key`, env `XAI_API_KEY` |
| `grok` | responses | `https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1` | `xai_oauth` |
| `kimi` | anthropic | `https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic` | `api_key`, env `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| `cursor` | cursor | Cursor backend (current documented URL) | `cursor_oauth` |
| `kimi-code` | anthropic | `https://api.kimi.com/coding` | `kimi_oauth` |
| `zhipu` | anthropic | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic` | `api_key`, env `ZHIPUAI_API_KEY` |
| `minimax-cn` | anthropic | `https://api.minimax.cn/anthropic` | `api_key`, env `MINIMAX_API_KEY` |

`kimi` and `kimi-code` are distinct presets for distinct services: `kimi` is the metered Moonshot
API (`auth = "api_key"`, env `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`), while `kimi-code` is the subscription-billed Kimi
Code service on a different host, authenticated via the device-code flow
(`shunt login kimi --name <account-name>`) and pool-capable like `claude_oauth`/`chatgpt_oauth`.

Exact URLs must be taken from the existing adapters/docs at implementation
time, not from this table if they drift.

No preset overrides `count_tokens`: every upstream keeps the field's normal
serde default (`tiktoken`), which is only meaningful for `responses` and
`cursor` kinds — `anthropic`-kind upstreams (including `kimi`, `kimi-code`, `zhipu`, and
`minimax-cn`) always forward `count_tokens` requests upstream regardless of the setting.
Operators override per upstream with the explicit `count_tokens` field as today.

### 1.3 `auth` — string or map

Serde untagged: a bare string `"claude_oauth"` is shorthand for
`{ mode = "claude_oauth" }`. The map is internally tagged by `mode` (the
existing `AuthMode` strings) and absorbs the legacy sibling fields:

| mode | map fields |
|---|---|
| `passthrough` | — |
| `api_key` | `env` (required unless preset supplies it), `header` (default as today) |
| `claude_oauth` / `chatgpt_oauth` / `kimi_oauth` | optional scope: `account = "name"` (single) **or** `accounts = [...]` (subset; entries are full `AccountConfig` tables or bare name strings referencing the store). No scope → whole store scan (`~/.shunt/accounts/kimi/` for `kimi_oauth`); for `chatgpt_oauth` an empty store additionally falls through to the single-account `~/.codex/auth.json` path (both preserved today's behavior). `kimi_oauth` has no such single-account fallback — the shunt-managed store is its only source. Setting both `account` and `accounts` is an error. |
| `xai_oauth` / `cursor_oauth` / `antigravity_oauth` | as today (no scoping fields yet) |

Unknown map keys for a mode are errors (strict), mirroring the reference's
strict per-provider auth objects.

### 1.4 Legacy `[providers.<name>]` compatibility

- Parses exactly as today (string `auth` + `api_key_env`/`api_key_header`/
  `accounts` siblings). Sibling fields remain valid **only** in the legacy
  table; inside `[[upstreams]]` the auth map is the only spelling.
- After load, each legacy provider becomes one implicit upstream named after
  its table key, in name-sorted order (today's `BTreeMap` iteration), flagged
  *unordered*.
- Declaring both `[[upstreams]]` and any `[providers.*]` in the config file →
  hard error: use exactly one file-layer declaration form. Environment variables
  may override fields by normalized upstream/provider name under either form via
  `SHUNT_PROVIDERS__<name>__<field>`; declare the ordered `[[upstreams]]` array in
  the config file rather than trying to synthesize the whole array in one env var.
- A multi-entry `upstream_model` map with legacy (unordered) providers → hard
  error whose message shows the exact rewrite (`[providers.codex]` →
  `[[upstreams]]` + `name = "codex"`). No silent alphabetical failover.

### 1.5 Validation summary (new rules)

1. `upstreams[].name`: required, non-empty, non-whitespace, unique.
2. Unknown `provider` preset → error listing presets.
3. Without a preset, `kind` and `base_url` are required (as today).
4. `auth` map: mode-specific strict fields; `account` xor `accounts`.
5. Both `[[upstreams]]` and `[providers.*]` present in the config file → error.
6. `upstream_model` maps: existing per-entry rules (non-empty key/value, known
   upstream name, no `[1m]` suffix, no `[[routes]]` conflict) unchanged;
   multi-entry maps additionally require ordered `[[upstreams]]`.
7. Same-kind upstreams under distinct names are legal; nothing may assume at
   most one upstream per kind or per auth mode.

## 2. Chain resolution (routing)

The inbound Codex Responses endpoint is intentionally narrower than this generic chain resolver:
its pinned `[server.codex_endpoint].provider` is the fallback, and only one exact compatible
Responses declaration can override it. Prefix routes, multi-entry chains, translated adapters,
and model-rewriting aliases are rejected or ignored for native ingress as documented; this
failover chain never hops providers after response output has begun.

- For a model whose `upstream_model` map has N entries: the chain is the
  `[[upstreams]]` declaration order filtered to names that are keys of the
  map. Map order is irrelevant. An upstream not named in the map does not
  participate (no builtin-catalog fallback — stricter than the reference,
  deliberate).
- Single-entry maps and map-less models resolve exactly as today (one-element
  chain; `[[routes]]`, prefixes, default provider unchanged).
- `Route` gains nothing; `resolve_request` returns an ordered non-empty list
  of `Route`s (`resolve_request_chain`); existing single-route callers use the
  first element.
- The `[1m]` context-window-hint stripping and effort defaulting apply per
  chain element as today.

## 3. Failover loop (proxy) — reference contract

Wraps adapter dispatch in `forward()`. Per attempt, in chain order:

1. Dispatch to the element's adapter. The response status is known before the
   body streams (lazy body), so inspecting it buffers nothing.
2. **Advance to the next element** when: the adapter returns a relayed
   response with status `429`, `401`, `403`, `404`, or any `5xx`; or the
   adapter fails before returning response headers (connect/TLS/header-phase
   network failure, translated 502). This is the failover boundary: streaming
   adapters return at header time with a lazy body, so a transport failure
   after 2xx headers but before or during the body surfaces to the client as
   today and does not re-enter the chain. Adapters must preserve the raw
   upstream status or failure class through `AdapterError`, so this
   classification happens before client-facing status mapping. Today's
   Responses and Cursor error mappings both flatten `404` to `502` via
   `client_facing_status`; both must be extended to carry the raw class. Remember the best failure so far with preference
   `429 → 401/403 → 404 → other 5xx`; drop superseded remembered responses
   unread.
3. **Return immediately** on any other status (2xx, 400, …).
4. Once a 2xx response's headers have been returned to the client there is no
   failover; any subsequent body/transport failure surfaces to the client as
   today.
5. Chain exhausted: return the remembered best failure; if none was
   remembered, synthesize `502 api_error` with message
   `all upstreams failed (N attempted)` in the Anthropic error shape.

Response headers on every proxied response (success or final failure):
`x-gateway-upstream` (upstream name), `x-gateway-model` (client-requested id),
`x-gateway-upstream-model` (mapped upstream id).

### Gemini generation acceptance boundary

Gemini Code Assist generation is a non-idempotent creation POST. Within one
Gemini upstream, its bounded retry policy may reissue only a transient
connection or timeout failure that resolves before response headers. A returned
status is never retried against the same upstream because the provider may
already have accepted the billable generation. The token, selected project,
endpoint, and serialized request remain identical on a permitted pre-header
retry.

The ordered chain above still classifies a relayed status for cross-upstream
advancement; that is a move to a separately configured route, not a same-upstream
retry. There is no retry, account switch, route hop, or repair after response-body
processing begins or any output or replay-unsafe tool activity occurs. Gemini
also requires an authoritative provider finish plus clean closure, so malformed,
truncated, or provider-error bodies fail explicitly without re-entering either
the retry loop or the failover chain.

### Capability-aware fallback

After resolving an ordered chain, shunt preserves the first (primary) route
unconditionally and filters only later candidates that cannot faithfully carry
requirements visible in the Anthropic Messages request. Filtering happens
before chain-aware inbound authentication, credential lookup, request mutation,
or network dispatch. It is internal behavior and has no configuration keys.

The gate recognizes a non-empty `tools` array, base64 and URL images in message
or nested tool-result content, non-null `output_config.format`, string
`output_config.effort`, and a trailing `[1m]` / `[1M]` model hint. Unknown or
malformed shapes are ignored by this gate and remain the selected adapter's
validation responsibility.

| Requirement | Anthropic | Responses | Gemini / Antigravity | Cursor | Antigravity CLI |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Tools | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| Base64 images | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| URL images | yes | yes | no | no | no |
| Structured output | yes | no | no | no | no |
| Explicit effort | yes | yes | no | no | no |

For `[1m]`, every fallback is excluded because shunt does not maintain trusted
context-window metadata per target; the primary still runs normally. Each
exclusion emits a warning with provider, model, and bounded reasons, plus
`shunt.failover{state=capability_excluded}`. Request content never becomes a
metric label.

Cross-cutting:

- **Inbound auth gating**: inbound auth remains optional exactly as today. When
  inbound auth is configured, the gating check considers the whole chain: the
  request is gated if *any* chain element injects credentials
  (`auth != passthrough`), not just the first. Credential stripping moves with
  it: today `check_inbound_auth` removes the client's `authorization` /
  `x-api-key` headers up front, which in a mixed chain would destroy the
  credentials a `passthrough` element must forward. In a chain the gate only
  authenticates; stripping (and the `x-shunt-inbound-client` stamp) is
  deferred to per-upstream dispatch and applied only when dispatching to an
  element that injects credentials, so a `passthrough` element still receives
  the client's original headers. (The anti-spoof removal of inbound-only
  headers from unauthenticated requests stays at the gate.) On failover a
  `passthrough` attempt keeps the client's `authorization` / `x-api-key` only
  when the *primary* route is itself `passthrough` **and** the attempt's
  destination origin matches that primary's: the caller's credential is then its
  own upstream credential, origin-specific to the primary, so a `passthrough`
  attempt on a *different* origin strips it and fails closed rather than replaying
  a host-specific token to another origin. A same-origin fallback (e.g. two
  passthrough entries on one host) still carries the credential and keeps working.
  When the primary instead injects its own credential, the client headers are a
  gateway/client secret rather than an upstream credential, so every `passthrough`
  fallback strips them regardless of origin.
  Layered on top of that origin rule, each slot a same-origin attempt retains is
  also checked *by the value it holds*: `authorization` and `x-api-key` are each
  cleared when that slot's own value is one of shunt's own inbound credentials —
  a `[server.gateway]` JWT or a configured `[server.auth]` static token — never
  both slots because one of them does. The gateway-JWT half of that check is
  deliberately by *shape*, not by whether the token currently authenticates
  (`jwt::has_shunt_shape`): a do-not-forward decision asks "did shunt issue
  this?", not "is this valid right now?", so an expired token, one minted by a
  sibling instance under a different `public_url`, or one that no longer
  verifies after a `jwt_secret` rotation is still recognized and stripped —
  forwarding it would leak the caller's identity and hand the upstream a
  signature oracle over `jwt_secret`. An `apiKeyHelper` fills both slots with the
  same value, so either credential can land in either or both beside a genuine
  upstream credential that must keep flowing. The origin filter runs first: an
  off-origin attempt strips both slots outright, and the by-value check applies
  only to whatever the origin filter retained (`auth::inbound::consumed_by`,
  shared with model discovery; see `docs/m4-inbound-auth.md` §2).
- **count_tokens**: answered from the first chain element, as a chain has one
  advertised id; no failover for count_tokens.
- **Metrics**: per-attempt `record_proxied_request` labeled by upstream name,
  plus a failover counter (attempted/advanced/exhausted) so dashboards can see
  chain pressure. Exact metric name settled at implementation.
- **`[server.codex_endpoint]`**: out of scope; stays pinned to its configured
  upstream.

## 4. Pool and account state

The pool survives as the **intra-upstream** mechanism; the chain is the
**inter-upstream** mechanism.

- An upstream's auth scope defines its pool membership: whole store, subset,
  or single account. Selection (`select_order`, quota-aware rotation,
  burn-rate avoidance, storm control) runs unchanged within that membership.
- Pool exhaustion already surfaces as a relayed advance-class status
  (`401`/`429`/`5xx`) or a translated `502` — all are advance classes in §3,
  so exhaustion flows into the chain without a special case.
- **Physical-account state sharing**: per-account state (quota windows,
  health, cooldowns, in-flight admission counts, refresh locks) is re-keyed
  from provider name to *(store family, stable account identity)*. Identity
  follows the existing `account_identity()` rule — account UUID when present,
  name as fallback — with the UUID read from the account's *resolved*
  credentials (the store entry or inline credential material, e.g. the Claude
  account UUID or `chatgpt_account_id`), not from the static TOML view alone,
  so an explicit `account = "acct-1"` reference and a whole-store scan that
  resolve to the same store entry produce the same key and coalesce.
  Cross-upstream sharing requires this verified identity: two upstreams share
  an account's state only when their accounts carry the same verified
  UUID/account id or resolve to the same store entry (bare-name store
  references). A UUID-less inline `AccountConfig` table is upstream-scoped: its
  fallback key is namespaced by the upstream name, so same-named inline
  accounts with different credentials under different upstreams never merge.
  (Today's name fallback is safe only because the key includes the provider
  name; an un-namespaced global name key would merge distinct accounts.)
  Selection scope remains per upstream.
- `[server.pool]` stays global. The `state_path` persistence file's key schema
  changes; bump its schema/version marker and ignore incompatible files (one
  cold start; it is a warm-start cache). Same for the gateway-sessions file if
  its keys embed provider names (verify at implementation).
- `usage_refresh_seconds` polling iterates physical accounts deduplicated
  across upstreams.
- Admin dashboard: snapshot per upstream (its selection scope); an account
  referenced by several upstreams appears under each, backed by the same
  shared state.

## 5. Migration

Documented user-facing in the site guide; summarized here.

- **No action** for existing configs: the legacy table keeps parsing unchanged,
  implicit upstreams inherit provider names, and existing `upstream_model` maps
  (keyed by those names) retain their routing and selection semantics. Three
  behavior changes apply under both config forms. Legacy providers that
  reference the same physical account now share per-account runtime state,
  which was previously provider-scoped; this is a deliberate behavior change
  shipped with this feature and called out in migration. In addition, every
  proxied response now carries the additive `x-gateway-upstream`,
  `x-gateway-model`, and `x-gateway-upstream-model` metadata headers. Finally,
  on the Anthropic Messages route (`/v1/messages`), a Claude or Codex OAuth pool
  of any size whose attempts all fail before response headers now returns the
  synthesized `all upstreams failed (N attempted)` message described in §6.
  The separate `[server.codex_endpoint]` inbound path is unaffected and keeps
  `all Codex OAuth accounts failed before receiving an upstream response`.
- **To adopt failover**: rewrite each `[providers.<name>]` table as an
  `[[upstreams]]` entry (`name = "<name>"`, same fields; fold
  `api_key_env`/`api_key_header`/`accounts` into the `auth` map), order
  entries by preference, then add entries to the model's `upstream_model`
  map. Presets typically shrink entries to `name` + `provider` (+ auth scope).
  Caution: preset auth defaults apply only when the entry omits `auth` — e.g.
  the `kimi` preset reads `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` (Moonshot's official convention),
  while older shunt examples used `KIMI_API_KEY`; either export the new name
  or keep the old one explicitly via
  `auth = { mode = "api_key", env = "KIMI_API_KEY" }`.
- Pool persistence file: discarded once on upgrade (cold start), by version
  bump.

## 6. Implementation deviations

- **Pre-header failures are not remembered.** An adapter failure translated to a
  `502` before upstream response headers arrive
  (`AdapterFailure::BeforeHeaders`) advances the chain but is not eligible for
  the remembered best failure; only relayed upstream statuses (`429`, `401`,
  `403`, `404`, and `5xx`) are remembered. If every attempt fails before
  headers, shunt therefore returns the synthesized `502 api_error`
  `all upstreams failed (N attempted)`. On the Anthropic Messages route this
  outer-chain synthesis now replaces the pool-specific pre-header exhaustion
  messages for Claude and Codex OAuth pools of any size:
  `all Claude OAuth accounts failed before receiving an upstream response` and
  `all Codex OAuth accounts failed before receiving an upstream response`.
  `[server.codex_endpoint]` is unaffected and retains the latter Codex-specific
  message. This is a third migration behavior change beyond the two deliberate
  changes originally listed in §5.
- **Local adapter errors do not fail over.** Gateway-originated errors that do
  not represent an upstream failure — for example auth misconfiguration,
  Cursor adapter-owned errors, or WebSocket header construction failures —
  return immediately without advancing the chain. This keeps configuration
  errors visible instead of masking them behind another upstream.

## 7. Implementation surface

| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| Schema, presets, auth map, validation, implicit upstreams | `src/config.rs` (split new modules if it would exceed the 500-line file guidance: e.g. `src/config/upstreams.rs`, `src/config/presets.rs`) |
| Chain resolution | `src/routing.rs` |
| Failover loop, headers, gating, metrics | `src/proxy.rs`, `src/metrics.rs`, `src/adapters/mod.rs`, `src/adapters/responses/error.rs`, `src/adapters/cursor/mod.rs`, `src/model/responses.rs` |
| Account-state re-keying, auth-map credential resolution, persistence version bump | `src/accounts.rs`, `src/state_persist.rs`, `src/usage_poll.rs`, `src/adapters/anthropic/mod.rs`, `src/adapters/responses/pool.rs`, `src/auth/mod.rs`, `src/admin/` |
| Tests | config/routing unit tests; `tests/passthrough.rs`-style wiremock integration tests for chain order, advance classes, best-failure preference, header parity, gating, raw status/failure-class propagation through every adapter path |

Internal identifiers (`ProviderConfig`, `Route.provider`, `route.provider`
pool keys) keep their names in this change; renaming to `Upstream*` is a
follow-up.

## 8. Out of scope / follow-ups

- Builtin model-catalog fallback for upstreams missing from a model's map
  (reference behavior; shunt stays strict).
- User-defined preset tables.
- Auth-scope fields for `xai_oauth` / `cursor_oauth`.
- Internal `Provider*` → `Upstream*` rename.
- Legacy `[providers.*]` deprecation timeline (none planned pre-1.0).
- First-body-frame peek before committing a 2xx to the client, so
  header-successful-but-immediately-dead upstreams could still fail over
  (precedent: the Codex WS first-event peek fallback).
