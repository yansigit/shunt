# Running shunt

> How to build, configure, and run `shunt`, then point Claude Code at it.
> Based on the [Connect Claude Code to an LLM gateway](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway-connect)
> guide — shunt *is* the gateway you connect to.

`shunt` is a spec-compliant Claude Code LLM gateway. You run it locally, set
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` so Claude Code talks to it instead of `api.anthropic.com`, and it
**diverts only the models you map** to another provider (OpenAI or a reused ChatGPT/Codex
subscription). Everything else passes through to Anthropic unchanged.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable) with `cargo` — see `Cargo.toml`. Build with `cargo build`.
- **Claude Code** v2.1.129+ (only if you want [model discovery](#55-optional-model-discovery);
  the primary `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` path works on any recent version).
- A credential for whichever provider you map:
  - **OpenAI API key** for the `openai` provider, or
  - **A ChatGPT login** via the Codex CLI (`codex login`) for the `codex`/`chatgpt` provider.
- Your normal **Anthropic credential** (claude.ai login or an API key) — shunt forwards it
  through for every model you *don't* map.

---

## 2. Build

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (recommended for daily use)
cargo build --release   # -> target/release/shunt
```

You can also run straight from the source tree with `cargo run -- <args>` (examples below).

---

## 3. Configure

shunt loads configuration from, in increasing precedence:

1. Built-in defaults (all providers preconfigured — see `src/config.rs`).
2. A **TOML or YAML file**. The format is chosen by extension — `.toml` is
   TOML, `.yaml`/`.yml` is YAML (any other extension is parsed as TOML). With
   `--config <path>` that exact file is used (a missing file is an error).
   Otherwise shunt takes the first file found, probing each directory for
   `shunt.toml`, then `shunt.yaml`, then `shunt.yml`, in this directory order:
   `./` → `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shunt/` (defaulting to `~/.config/shunt/`) →
   `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/etc/` (defaulting to the `/opt/homebrew` and
   `/usr/local` prefixes). A local `shunt.yaml` therefore still wins over a
   config file in a later directory. Boot logs report which file was loaded,
   or that defaults are in use.

   > **YAML 1.1 caveat:** the YAML backend parses YAML 1.1, where bare `yes`,
   > `no`, `on`, `off`, `y`, `n` (any case) become booleans. Quote any string
   > value that is one of these tokens (e.g. `api_key_env: "no"`), or
   > deserialization fails with a type error. TOML is unaffected.
3. **Environment variables** prefixed `SHUNT_`, using `__` for nested keys
   (e.g. `SHUNT_SERVER__BIND=0.0.0.0:3001`).

Because the defaults already define every provider, your config only needs the parts you
want to change. Start from either template:

```bash
cp shunt.toml.example shunt.toml  # TOML
cp shunt.yaml.example shunt.yaml  # YAML
```

### 3.1 Config reference

# effort = "high"
# service_tier = "priority"    # Codex CLI's "Fast" mode; also accepts "fast" (alias), "flex"

# --- Routing: how a request's `model` id picks a provider ---

# Legacy exact-match form. `upstream_model` and `effort` are optional overrides.
# Prefer [[models]] + [models.upstream_model] for exact ids.
[[routes]]
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
provider = "codex"
# upstream_model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
# effort = "high"          # gpt-5.6 and gpt-6 slugs also accept "max"

# Then prefix match.
[[route_prefixes]]
prefix = "gpt-"
provider = "openai"

# Optional: expose Claude-named aliases in the /model picker via discovery (§5.5).
# The id MUST start with "claude" or "anthropic" or Claude Code ignores it.
# [[models]]
# id = "claude-opus-via-codex"
# display_name = "Opus (via Codex)"
#
# [models.upstream_model] # optional: advertise, route, and translate in one entry
# codex = "gpt-5.2"       # exactly one configured provider is supported

# Optional: error reporting to your own Sentry project. Off unless a DSN is
# set; nothing is ever sent by default. Reports gateway-owned diagnostics —
# fatal gateway startup/serve errors, panics, and error-level log events, with
# warn/info as breadcrumbs — plus, unconditionally once a DSN is set, an
# error/warning event whenever an upstream provider itself returns a failure:
# error for a 5xx response, warning for 429/529 (rate limit/overload), each
# tagged with model, provider, and upstream_status only. A streaming request
# that answers 200 and then fails mid-stream (an `event: error` frame, or the
# connection cut before a terminal event) also reports: error for the former,
# warning for the latter, tagged with model, provider, and outcome
# (issue #287). A cut also carries a cut_kind tag (eof, transport_error, or
# marker) plus diagnostic context — SSE events and bytes forwarded, the last
# event type, elapsed/TTFT in ms, and the upstream error message for a
# transport_error (issue #310). Mid-stream events are rate-limited in-process
# so a retrying client cannot flood the project; the shunt.stream_outcome
# metric below is never throttled. Request/response bodies, headers,
# credentials, and the host name are never sent: breadcrumbs keep only the log
# message (field values are stripped), and tracing spans attach only when you
# opt into tracing via traces_sample_rate below. An empty DSN (e.g.
# SHUNT_SENTRY__DSN="") disables reporting again; an invalid DSN or an
# out-of-range traces_sample_rate is a startup error.
# [sentry]
# dsn = "https://<key>@<org>.ingest.sentry.io/<project>"
# environment = "home-lab"   # optional environment tag on events
# metrics = false            # (default) separate opt-in: also send usage metrics.
#                            # See the metric series below. Aggregates only — no
#                            # prompts, client names, account ids, or session ids.
# traces_sample_rate = 0.0   # (default) separate opt-in: also send performance
#                            # traces. The per-request span (method, path) becomes
#                            # a Sentry transaction, head-sampled at this rate in
#                            # [0.0, 1.0]; 0.0 sends no spans at all. Mirrors
#                            # [otel] sample_ratio.
# include_session_id = false # (default) withhold the client session id from
#                            # spans sent to Sentry (mirrors [otel])

# Optional: OpenTelemetry (OTLP) export to your own collector/backend. Off
# unless an endpoint is set. Independent of [sentry] — both can run together.
# Exports up to three signals over OTLP/HTTP (protobuf): request spans
# (traces), the metric series below (metrics), and shunt's log events (logs;
# the stderr logs are unaffected).
# Metrics and traces stay low-cardinality and carry no request/response bodies —
# the span's client session id is attached only when `include_session_id = true`.
# The logs signal exports shunt's diagnostic events as written, so like the
# stderr logs it can include request-derived fields (an upstream error body, a
# client id); set `logs = false` for body-free export. The resource carries
# service.*/telemetry.sdk.* (no host or process detector) plus any
# OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES you set. An empty endpoint (e.g. SHUNT_OTEL__ENDPOINT="")
# disables again; an invalid endpoint or an out-of-range sample_ratio is a
# startup error. The endpoint and service_name come from this config (they take
# precedence over OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT / OTEL_SERVICE_NAME); the standard
# OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS and OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES env vars are merged in.
# Editing [otel] then hot-reloading warns and needs a restart to take effect.
# [otel]
# endpoint = "http://localhost:4318"  # OTLP/HTTP base; /v1/{traces,metrics,logs} appended
# service_name = "shunt"     # (default) service.name resource attribute
# environment = "prod"       # optional deployment.environment.name
# sample_ratio = 1.0         # (default) head-based trace sampling in [0.0, 1.0]
# traces = true              # (default) export request spans
# metrics = true             # (default) export usage metrics
# logs = true                # (default) export log events
# include_session_id = false # (default) withhold the client session id from spans
# [otel.headers]             # optional per-request headers (e.g. a hosted-collector token)
# authorization = "Bearer <token>"
```

Both metric sinks export the same low-cardinality series:

| Series | Type | Attributes | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `shunt.requests` | Counter | `provider`, `model`, `http.response.status_code` | Inference requests; token-count requests are excluded. |
| `shunt.latency` | Histogram (ms) | `provider`, `model`, `http.response.status_code` | Time to response headers for streams and full latency for non-streaming responses. |
| `shunt.ttft` | Histogram (ms) | `provider`, `model` | Time from request start to the first SSE body chunk. |
| `shunt.stream_outcome` | Counter | `provider`, `model`, `outcome` | Exactly one stream result: `completed`, `error_event`, `upstream_cut`, or `client_disconnect`. |
| `shunt.tokens` | Counter | `provider`, `model`, `kind` | Last reported streaming usage for `input`, `output`, `cache_read`, or `cache_creation`; non-streaming usage is not recorded. |
| `shunt.codex_continuation` | Counter | `provider`, `outcome` | Codex WebSocket continuation `hit` or full-input `fallback`. |
| `shunt.codex_ws_overflow` | Counter | `provider`, `outcome` | Codex WebSocket dedicated overflow connection `opened` or ceiling-`refused` (issue #248). |
| `shunt.upstream_retries` | Counter | `provider`, `reason` | Bounded transient retries. |
| `shunt.pool.quota_utilization` | Gauge | `provider`, `window` | Minimum utilization across enabled, non-stale accounts for `5h`, `7d`, or `7d_oi`. |
| `shunt.pool.rotations` | Counter | `provider`, `reason` | Account rotations and pool exhaustion by low-cardinality cause. |
| `shunt.pool.reprobes` | Counter | `provider` | Reprobes committed at the first HTTP dispatch for stale near-quota Codex/ChatGPT accounts; WebSocket-enabled providers count inbound HTTP probes only. |

**Routing precedence** (`src/routing.rs`): matching `[models.upstream_model]` entry → exact
`[[routes]]` match → `[[route_prefixes]]` prefix match → `server.default_provider`. A model
with no match falls through to Anthropic.

### 3.2 Adding a provider

Providers are a **name → config map**, so a new upstream is just another `[providers.<name>]`
table — **no code change**. figment deep-merges the map, so a partial override of a built-in
(e.g. only `[providers.codex] effort = "high"`) keeps the rest of that provider's defaults, while
a brand-new table adds a provider. Every provider takes these keys:

| Key | Values | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `kind` | `anthropic` \| `responses` \| `cursor` | Upstream protocol / adapter. `anthropic` = Messages API (passed through, optionally re-keyed); `responses` = Anthropic Messages translated to the OpenAI Responses API; `cursor` = Cursor's native ConnectRPC/protobuf AgentService. |
| `base_url` | URL | Upstream base; shunt appends the provider endpoint path. |
| `auth` | `passthrough` \| `api_key` \| `chatgpt_oauth` \| `claude_oauth` \| `kimi_oauth` \| `xai_oauth` \| `cursor_oauth` | `passthrough` forwards the client's credential; `api_key` injects `api_key_env`; `chatgpt_oauth` uses Codex/ChatGPT OAuth; `claude_oauth` selects an Anthropic subscription account pool (see §3.3); `kimi_oauth` selects a Kimi Code subscription account pool (`shunt login kimi`; see the Kimi Code example below); `xai_oauth` and `cursor_oauth` reuse their shunt-managed subscription logins. |
| `api_key_env` | env var name | Where the key is read from, when `auth = "api_key"`. |
| `api_key_header` | `bearer` (default) \| `x_api_key` | Header the injected key is sent in. |
| `effort` | `low`…`max` | Optional default reasoning effort (`responses` providers). |
| `service_tier` | `fast`, `priority`, `flex`, `default` | Optional Codex CLI "Fast" mode opt-in (`responses` providers); `fast` normalizes to the `priority` wire value, `default` is a client-only sentinel that is never sent. Off by default. See [codex-configuration.md §9](codex-configuration.md#9-fast-mode-service_tier). |
| `count_tokens` | `tiktoken` (default) \| `estimate` | For `responses` and `cursor` providers: `tiktoken` computes a local count (o200k_base) and returns `{"input_tokens": N}`; `estimate` returns `501 not_supported` so the client falls back on its own. See §4. |

Most third-party "use Claude Code with X" gateways are **Anthropic-Messages-compatible**: they are
`kind = "anthropic"` with `auth = "api_key"`, differing only in `base_url` and the key env var.
shunt injects the key and forwards the request. When the routed upstream model is not an
Anthropic id (`claude*` / `anthropic/*`), it also strips Claude Code's deferred-tool protocol
(`defer_loading`, `tool_search_tool_*`) — OpenRouter's skin (and similar hosts) reject that
protocol on stealth and other non-Anthropic slugs with HTTP 400. Anthropic models keep the
fields. Ready-to-use entries (uncomment in
`shunt.toml.example`, set the env var, add a `[[routes]]` line):

| Provider | `base_url` | Example model IDs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Kimi (Moonshot) | `https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic` | `kimi-k3[1m]`, `kimi-k2.7-code` |
| Kimi Code (subscription, OAuth) | `https://api.kimi.com/coding` | use the ids your subscription exposes |
| DeepSeek | `https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic` | `deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-flash` |
| Z.ai (GLM) | `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic` | `glm-5.2`, `glm-4.7` |
| Zhipu (GLM China) — built-in preset | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic` | `glm-5.3`, `glm-5.3-flash` |
| MiniMax | `https://api.minimax.io/anthropic` | see [MiniMax docs](https://platform.minimax.io/docs/token-plan/claude-code) |
| MiniMax China — built-in preset | `https://api.minimax.cn/anthropic` | `MiniMax-M3` |
| Mimo (Xiaomi) | `https://api.xiaomimimo.com/anthropic` | `mimo-v2.5-pro` — see [Mimo docs](https://mimo.mi.com/docs/en-US/tokenplan/integration/claudecode) |
| OpenRouter | `https://openrouter.ai/api` | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8`, `~anthropic/claude-sonnet-latest` |
| Vercel AI Gateway | `https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh` | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.8` (accepts `x_api_key`) |

`zhipu` and `minimax-cn` are also built-in presets, so they do not need a `[providers.*]` table
from `shunt.toml.example`. Use the ordered `[[upstreams]]` form instead — for example,
`provider = "zhipu"` or `provider = "minimax-cn"` — and keep the `anthropic` passthrough default.

Every row above but one takes `auth = "api_key"`. **Kimi Code** is the exception: a separate,
subscription-billed Kimi service from the metered Moonshot API in the row above it — different
host, and OAuth instead of an API key. It has a dedicated built-in `kimi-code` preset (`kind =
"anthropic"`, `base_url = "https://api.kimi.com/coding"`, `auth = "kimi_oauth"`), so it needs no
manual `[providers.*]` table, just a logged-in account and the ordered `[[upstreams]]` form
(§1.2 in [upstreams-failover.md](upstreams-failover.md)) that resolves preset shortcuts —
the plain `[providers.<name>]` map used elsewhere in this section has no preset lookup:

```bash
shunt login kimi --name <account-name>   # RFC 8628 device flow -> ~/.shunt/accounts/kimi/<account-name>.json
```

```toml
# shunt.toml — route to your Kimi Code subscription
[[upstreams]]
name = "kimi-code"
provider = "kimi-code"
auth = { mode = "kimi_oauth", account = "<account-name>" }

# Declaring [[upstreams]] replaces the built-in provider set, so keep a trailing
# anthropic passthrough — without it `shunt check` rejects the default
# server.default_provider. This is the same entry `shunt init` appends.
[[upstreams]]
name = "anthropic"
provider = "anthropic"

[[routes]]
model = "<model-id-your-subscription-exposes>"
provider = "kimi-code"
```

`kimi_oauth` is pool-capable like `claude_oauth`/`chatgpt_oauth` — use `accounts = [...]` in place
of `account` to spread load across several stored Kimi accounts. See
[Kimi → Kimi Code (OAuth subscription)](https://shunt.dev/providers/kimi/#kimi-code-oauth-subscription)
for the full walkthrough.

For example, to route Kimi's (Moonshot) model through shunt:

```toml
[providers.kimi]
kind = "anthropic"
base_url = "https://api.moonshot.ai/anthropic"
auth = "api_key"
api_key_env = "MOONSHOT_API_KEY"

[[routes]]
model = "kimi-k3[1m]"
provider = "kimi"

[[routes]]
model = "kimi-k2.7-code"
provider = "kimi"
```

Then `export MOONSHOT_API_KEY=…`, point Claude Code at shunt (§5.1), and select `kimi-k3[1m]`
(via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` or the `/model` picker). Run `shunt check` to validate — it reports an
unknown provider in a route, a missing `api_key_env`, or a bad `base_url`.

### 3.3 Provisioning Anthropic pool accounts

When an Anthropic provider uses `auth = "claude_oauth"`, create each private store account with one of three login modes:

```bash
# Recommended: create a new refreshable credential.
shunt login claude --name primary --mode oauth

# Copy the current Claude Code refreshable login.
shunt login claude --name imported --mode import

# Create a one-year, inference-only static token.
shunt login claude --name ci --mode setup-token
```

If `--mode` is omitted on a TTY, shunt presents these three choices and defaults to OAuth; non-interactive input retains the historical import default. `--long-lived` remains a deprecated alias for `--mode setup-token`.

Full OAuth first binds an ephemeral listener to `127.0.0.1`, opens the authorization URL, and receives the redirect at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback`. Browser-open, bind, callback, and 5-minute timeout failures fall back to a hidden manual-paste prompt. Use `--manual` to choose the paste flow immediately, especially over SSH:

```bash
shunt login claude --name remote --mode oauth --manual
```

The optional `[server.admin]` dashboard can provision full-OAuth or setup-token accounts remotely with the manual redirect. Its UI defaults to full OAuth; the start API accepts `mode = "oauth"` or `mode = "setup_token"` and defaults an omitted mode to `setup_token` for backward compatibility. Import remains CLI-only because it reads the host's existing Claude Code credential.

Refreshable files contain rotating credentials. A successful refresh can replace the refresh token and invalidate its previous value, so give each file exactly one active shunt owner. Do not share the same file across processes or independently run copied snapshots on multiple hosts; provision each process separately. Setup-token accounts are non-refreshable and do not have this rotation hazard.

See [`m8-anthropic-multi-account.md`](m8-anthropic-multi-account.md), [`m9-admin-surface.md`](m9-admin-surface.md), and the user-facing [CLI reference](../site/src/content/docs/reference/cli.mdx) for the complete pool and provisioning behavior.

### 3.4 Validate the config

```bash
cargo run -- check            # or: shunt check   /   shunt --check
# -> prints "config ok", or a specific error (bad bind address, unknown provider, …)
```

Beyond config validation, `check` runs the boot path's routed-Antigravity
credential guard (issue #382): a config that routes to the native `antigravity`
upstream with no credential in `~/.shunt/antigravity-auth.json` fails here, with
the same message `shunt run` refuses to start with, rather than passing the
check and dying at startup. The guard is keyed on the config being able to route
to such a provider — not on the built-in `antigravity` table merely existing,
which every default config has — and is offline: it probes the credential file's
existence and never refreshes a token or writes to it.

---

## 4. Run

```bash
# From the source tree
cargo run -- run                       # default subcommand is `run`, so `cargo run` also works
cargo run -- run --config ./shunt.toml

# From a release build
./target/release/shunt run
./target/release/shunt run --config /path/to/shunt.toml
```

On start it logs `shunt listening` with the bound address. Set log verbosity with `RUST_LOG`,
e.g. `RUST_LOG=shunt=debug cargo run -- run`.

### Run as a background service (Homebrew)

Installed via Homebrew, shunt can run under `brew services` instead of a foreground terminal:

```bash
brew services start shunt    # launches `shunt run` in the background
brew services restart shunt  # e.g. after a binary upgrade
brew services stop shunt     # sends SIGTERM; shunt drains to its deadline, then exits
brew services info shunt
```

`SIGTERM` and ctrl-c both stop new admission and start the same bounded drain. Active HTTP responses,
SSE streams, and upgraded WebSocket sessions may finish within `[server] shutdown_timeout_seconds`
(default `30`, valid `1..=3600`). One absolute deadline starts at the first signal and covers every
connection; when it expires, shunt cancels the remaining server work and returns normally so Rust
resource guards and telemetry exporters can be dropped. On Unix, Antigravity `agy` runs are terminated
as soon as shutdown starts because gateway signals do not reach their isolated process groups. Send a
**second** signal (another ctrl-c, or `kill` again) to skip the remaining drain and exit immediately
with the conventional 128+signal exit status: 143 for a second `SIGTERM`, 130 for a second
ctrl-c/`SIGINT`. That immediate-exit path also terminates Antigravity groups, but deliberately skips
normal telemetry flushing. See [Bounded shutdown](bounded-shutdown.md) for the lifecycle contract.

Logs go to `$(brew --prefix)/var/log/shunt.log` (stdout and stderr combined). Config discovery
works the same as any other invocation (see [§3 Configure](#3-configure)): a service has no
meaningful working directory, so the search starts at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shunt` (or
`~/.config/shunt`) — an existing config there still wins over the Homebrew prefix. Absent one,
the effective candidate is `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/etc/shunt.toml` (`$(brew --prefix)/etc/shunt.toml`,
or `.yaml`/`.yml`). Run `shunt init --root "$(brew --prefix)/etc"` to create a starter file
there, or place your own wherever should win — check the boot log to see which file the service
actually loaded.

Editing the file the service actually loaded does **not** require `brew services restart` — the
running process picks up the change automatically via [config hot-reload](config-reload.md)
(file-watch, or send `SIGHUP` yourself). Only the handful of fields listed under [§4 Fields that
require a restart](config-reload.md#4-fields-that-require-a-restart) need an actual `brew services
restart`.

### Endpoints served

| Method | Path                          | Purpose                                             |
| :----- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `HEAD` | `/`                           | Liveness probe                                      |
| `GET`  | `/`                           | Human-readable landing (version + endpoint list)    |
| `GET`  | `/health`                     | Healthcheck — `{"status":"ok","version":"x.y.z"}`   |
| `GET`  | `/v1/models`                  | Model discovery (returns your `[[models]]` entries) |
| `GET`  | `/routes`                     | Route discovery (returns your `[[routes]]` table)   |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages`                | Inference — routed per the request's `model` id     |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages/count_tokens`   | Token counting (see below)                          |

`GET /` and `GET /health` stay open even when `[server.auth]` is enabled (healthcheck tools
usually cannot attach tokens) and expose nothing sensitive — only status, version, and the
already-public endpoint list. They also bypass `max_concurrent_requests`, so saturation never
causes a load balancer to evict an instance that is still serving existing work.

All other routes count against `server.max_concurrent_requests` (default `1024`). shunt sheds an
excess request immediately with `503 overloaded_error` and `Retry-After: 1`; it never queues the
request. A streaming response holds its slot until the response body finishes or the client
disconnects. Set the value to `0` to retain unlimited concurrency. The limit is fixed at startup,
so changing it through config reload requires a restart.

**`count_tokens`:** for an **Anthropic-routed** model shunt passes the request through to the
upstream's `count_tokens` endpoint (exact counts). For a **`responses`-routed** model (codex/OpenAI)
there is no equivalent upstream endpoint, so the provider's `count_tokens` setting decides:

- `count_tokens = "tiktoken"` (default) — shunt computes the count locally with tiktoken's
  `o200k_base` encoder and returns `{"input_tokens": N}`. o200k_base is the GPT-family encoder, so
  for responses-routed models the text count is near-exact, though it can't see the backend's
  image/tool-schema encoding or cache accounting. Each count is answered in-process (~ms), which
  matters because Claude Code's `/context` issues one `count_tokens` call **per displayed item**
  (system-prompt section, memory file, agent, deferred tool, …) — 30–50 calls per invocation.
- `count_tokens = "estimate"` (opt-in) — shunt returns **501 `not_supported`**, telling Claude
  Code that the endpoint is unavailable and triggering its fallback. Note what Claude Code actually
  does then: the main-loop context bar estimates locally, but `/context` re-runs **every** category
  count against Haiku over the network — slow, and silently reported as 0 tokens when no Anthropic
  credential is available. Use it only if you want shunt to carry no tokenizer.

Either way the request never reaches the responses adapter, so a count request is never turned into
(and billed as) a full inference call. Opt out per provider:

```toml
[providers.codex]
kind = "responses"
count_tokens = "estimate"
```

## 5. Connect Claude Code

### 5.1 Point Claude Code at shunt

Set the base URL to your running gateway (default bind `127.0.0.1:3001`). Set it in your shell,
or persist it in a [settings file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings) `env` block.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001
```

Or in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:3001"
  }
}
```

Keep your existing Anthropic credential (claude.ai login, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` — §5.2 covers which to choose). shunt **forwards it unchanged** to
`api.anthropic.com` for every model you didn't map, so unmapped models keep working exactly as
before. Provider credentials for mapped models are injected by shunt itself (§5.3) — Claude Code
never sends them.

### 5.2 Choose the Anthropic credential

The credential Claude Code sends to shunt plays two roles: it authenticates **Claude passthrough
models** (forwarded unchanged to `api.anthropic.com`), and it **gates model discovery** — Claude
Code only issues the `GET /v1/models` request (§5.5) when `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, an API key, or
an `apiKeyHelper` is set; under a plain claude.ai login it sends nothing. Mapped models (`gpt-*`
etc.) are unaffected either way — shunt injects the provider credential for them (§5.3).

| Credential | Token refresh | Discovery (§5.5) | Claude passthrough | Billing |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| claude.ai OAuth **login** only | Claude Code refreshes it automatically | ❌ never fires | ✅ | subscription |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat…` (`claude setup-token`) — **recommended** | none needed (one-year token) | ✅ | ✅ | subscription |
| `apiKeyHelper` = `shunt token` (reuse the live login) | the helper refreshes it | ✅ | ✅ | subscription |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<real API key>` | none needed | ✅ | ✅ | **API (not subscription)** |

(A dummy value like `sk-dummy` satisfies the discovery gate but breaks passthrough — it is
forwarded to Anthropic and returns 401.)

**Prefer `claude setup-token`.** It mints a **one-year** OAuth token
([authentication docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#generate-a-long-lived-token)),
so nothing needs refreshing, and one value covers both roles — it satisfies the discovery gate
*and* authenticates Claude-passthrough models on your subscription:

```bash
claude setup-token                        # browser sign-in → prints sk-ant-oat…
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat…   # or persist it in a settings `env` block
```

The login-only row works because Claude Code keeps refreshing its own login while no gateway
credential is set — you only lose discovery (use `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION`, §5.4, instead).
The trap sits in between: **once a gateway credential is active, Claude Code stops refreshing the
login**, so the short-lived access token inside `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (macOS: Keychain)
expires within hours and a helper that just *reads* that file breaks. Refreshing it manually is
discouraged — `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token` is aggressively rate-limited/WAF-guarded (a
single stray call can return `429`), and it rewrites your live login file. To reuse the live
subscription login instead of minting a separate token, use the built-in `shunt token` helper,
which refreshes it safely.

#### The `shunt token` credential helper

`shunt token` prints a Claude subscription OAuth token to **stdout** (logs go to stderr), so it
can be wired straight into Claude Code's `apiKeyHelper`. It has two modes:

- **Static** — if `SHUNT_GATEWAY_TOKEN` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set, it echoes that value
  unchanged. Point it at a `claude setup-token` value and nothing is ever refreshed.
- **Auto-refresh** — otherwise it reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
  (override with `CLAUDE_CREDENTIALS`), returns the `claudeAiOauth` access token, and when it is
  within 5 minutes of `expiresAt` refreshes it against `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token` (the
  same grant Claude Code uses), then writes the new token back **atomically at `0600`, preserving
  every other field**. Refresh happens only on actual expiry, to respect the endpoint's rate limit.

Wire it up via `apiKeyHelper` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (or the project `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "apiKeyHelper": "/path/to/shunt token"
}
```

Claude Code calls the helper for its gateway credential, so discovery fires; `SHUNT_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
(static) vs. no override (auto-refresh) selects the mode. The refresh path touches your real login
file, so the static + `setup-token` route stays the simplest and safest default.

> **Why this works for Claude passthrough even though `apiKeyHelper` is an API-key mechanism.**
> Claude Code sends an `apiKeyHelper` value in **both** the `x-api-key` and `Authorization: Bearer`
> headers. A Claude subscription OAuth token (`sk-ant-oat…`) authenticates *only* as a bearer, so
> the copy echoed into `x-api-key` would otherwise make `api.anthropic.com` reject the request as

> path, which sends `x-api-key` and no bearer) is never touched. Without this normalization,
> `apiKeyHelper` + an OAuth token would only satisfy the discovery gate and mapped-model routes —
> Claude passthrough would 401.

#### The `shunt gateway token` credential helper

A different helper for a different credential. `shunt token` above prints an **upstream Claude
subscription** token; `shunt gateway token` prints an access token issued by a **shunt deployment
that has `[server.gateway]` enabled**, so each user carries their own gateway session instead of a
shared client token. The two are independent — neither reads the other's storage — and `shunt
login <provider>` and `shunt token` keep their existing upstream meaning.

Sign in once per machine, then wire the helper:

```bash
shunt gateway login https://gateway.example.com   # device flow; approve in a browser
shunt gateway token                                # prints the access token
shunt gateway logout                               # discards the stored session
```

`shunt gateway login` reads the deployment's `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` document,
prints a verification URL plus a user code, opens a browser (`--manual` prints the URL instead),
and polls until you approve. A URL that is plain `http://` and not loopback is accepted but warns:
the device code and refresh token would travel unencrypted, on every later refresh as well as
during this login. `shunt gateway token` repeats that warning on stderr each time it actually
refreshes — tied to a refresh rather than to every helper invocation, since the cached-token fast
path makes no network call at all. If the deployment answers the discovery request with `404`, it is most likely
missing `[server.gateway]`. Discovery and the device-code request are each bounded on the same
budget as the refresh path, so a deployment that completes the TCP handshake and then never answers
reports a timeout instead of waiting indefinitely with only Ctrl-C to end it. The approval poll is
deliberately excluded: waiting is its job, and it already has its own deadline plus a per-attempt
transport retry.

The discovery document is remote input, so two floors apply to what it can direct shunt to do. The
device code and refresh token are POSTed only to an endpoint advertised over `https`, or over `http`
to a loopback address — anything else fails discovery naming the offending endpoint, rather than
receiving the credential. That floor has one narrow widening, for the private-network and VPN
deployments that have no certificate to present: a gateway reached over plain `http`, accepted with
the unencrypted-traffic warning that repeats on every refresh, may advertise plaintext endpoints on
its **own origin** — scheme, host, and port all matching the operator-supplied base URL. The origin
is computed from that base URL and never from the document, so a hostile document cannot nominate
its own. Any other plaintext endpoint is refused unless its host is loopback — that carve-out is
independent of this widening and holds for every gateway, an `https` one included. (The check has to
happen here rather than falling out of the HTTP clients: the refresh POST follows no redirects at
all, and the redirect-hardened client that discovery uses vets only redirect *targets*, which a
document naming a bad endpoint outright never produces.) The verification URL is likewise handed to
the OS handler only when it is `http` or `https`: the gateway picks that string, and a `file://` or
`smb://` value would otherwise be acted on with no confirmation. It is printed either way.

The session lands in `~/.shunt/gateway/session.json` (override with `SHUNT_GATEWAY_SESSION_FILE`),
written owner-only — file `0600` inside a `0700` directory. Note that the similarly named
`SHUNT_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is unrelated: it is the static override for `shunt token`, described above.

```json
{
  "apiKeyHelper": "/path/to/shunt gateway token"
}
```

`shunt gateway token` prints the token and nothing else to stdout; every message goes to stderr.
It serves the stored token until it is within 5 minutes of expiry, then refreshes it. The
gateway's refresh tokens rotate and are single-use, so the refresh runs under an exclusive file
lock and re-reads the session after acquiring it: several Claude Code sessions can call the helper
at the same moment and only one refresh happens. Without that, the losing caller would replay a
spent refresh token, which revokes the whole rotation family and signs the user out everywhere.
`shunt gateway login` and `shunt gateway logout` take the same lock and hold it across their own
write, so neither can be undone by an in-flight refresh's writeback landing after it.

Neither the lock wait nor the refresh itself is unbounded. Each gateway round-trip is wrapped in a
timeout, and the lock is acquired non-blocking on a deadline rather than with a bare `LOCK_EX`. The
case that motivates both: a deployment that completes the TCP handshake and then never answers.
The holder would wait forever inside the critical section, and every other `apiKeyHelper` on the
machine would block behind it silently — one unreachable gateway taking down every Claude Code
session. The timeout is applied with `tokio::time::timeout` inside the gateway module rather than
as `reqwest`'s `.timeout()`, which is process-wide on the shared refresh client and also covers the
response body (streaming paths must never set it).

Crossing the 5-minute buffer makes a refresh *due*, not mandatory. If the refresh fails while the
cached token is still genuinely unexpired, that token is served with a warning on stderr, so a
brief network blip four minutes before real expiry does not become a user-visible auth failure;
once the token has actually expired the command fails hard. That fallback needs proof that nothing
was rotated, so it is restricted to the two failures that provably never presented the refresh
token: discovery, which never carries it, and a token POST that could not open a connection. From
the moment the POST is sent the gateway may already have rotated the token, so the bound expiring,
an unreadable or unparseable body, and any error the gateway names all fail the command instead —
serving the cached token there would leave a spent refresh token on disk for the next helper run
to replay. `expires_in` is clamped on the way in — a gateway reporting it in milliseconds would
otherwise cache a dead token as valid for weeks, with no recovery but deleting `session.json` by
hand. Clamping is safe even when it is wrong, since a too-short cached expiry only triggers an
earlier refresh. Finally, a token that would fail Claude Code's `apiKeyHelper` validator
(1..=16384 characters of printable ASCII, no whitespace) is refused with a diagnostic naming the
gateway rather than printed to fail authentication silently — and `shunt gateway login` puts the
token it is issued through that same gate before storing anything, so a deployment that cannot
produce a conforming one fails the login instead of saving a session that reports success and can
never be used.

`shunt gateway logout` removes the session but deliberately leaves the empty sibling `.lock` file
in place: that inode is what logout, login, and refresh serialize on, and unlinking it would let an
in-flight holder keep a lock on the old inode while the next process locks a freshly created one,
so the two would stop excluding each other.

#### Launching Claude Code with `shunt gateway claude`

`shunt gateway claude` does the wiring per invocation instead of asking you to edit settings:

```bash
shunt gateway claude
shunt gateway claude -p 'summarize this repo' --model opus
```

It launches `claude` with an inline `--settings` document that points `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at the
gateway from the stored session and sets `apiKeyHelper` to this shunt binary's absolute path plus
`gateway token`. The document applies to that one process — `~/.claude/settings.json` is never
modified — and it takes precedence over an `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` already exported in the shell, so
it is safe to run inside a shell configured for a different gateway (measured against Claude Code
2.1.234).

Everything after `claude` is forwarded verbatim, so Claude Code's own flags reach it unchanged.
Two exceptions when they lead the argument list: `--help` prints shunt's help, and `--config` is
**rejected with an error** rather than silently consumed by shunt's global option. Pass either
after `--` to forward it:

```bash
shunt gateway claude -- --config /path/to/claude/config
```

This route supplies the credential through `apiKeyHelper`, which leaves Claude Code in its
ordinary first-party mode; it does **not** put the client into a signed-in Claude apps gateway
session the way `forceLoginMethod: "gateway"` does. Which credential slot the token arrives in is
what selects that mode, and a gateway session additionally resolves the `opus`/`sonnet` aliases to
older model ids. This is not "no restrictions": the route still sets a credential, so Claude Code's
credential-type gate — the one any `apiKeyHelper` trips, covering prompt-cache TTL defaults, Remote
Control, voice dictation, and artifact publishing — applies here exactly as it does to `shunt token`
above. The two gates are independent. The consequence to plan around: shunt's per-user `GET /managed/settings` policy
channel is fetched by a signed-in gateway session, and a helper-credential session was not
observed requesting it (measured against Claude Code 2.1.234) — use `forceLoginMethod: "gateway"`
when you need the client to enforce per-user policy.

### 5.3 Provide the mapped provider's credential (to shunt, not Claude Code)

- **OpenAI provider:** export the key named by `api_key_env` (default `OPENAI_API_KEY`) in the
  environment shunt runs in. shunt also reads a key from `~/.codex/auth.json` when it's in
  `ApiKey` mode.
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  ```
- **Codex / ChatGPT provider:** log in with the Codex CLI once; shunt reads and auto-refreshes
  `~/.codex/auth.json`.
  ```bash
  codex login
  ```
  If the file is missing/expired, shunt returns an `authentication_error` telling you to run
  `codex login`.

#### xAI Grok — API key or subscription OAuth

> **⚠️ Experimental — not yet verified against the live xAI API.** Implemented from the
> reference clients (Hermes, OpenCode) and covered by unit tests with mocked endpoints;
> it has not been exercised with a real SuperGrok account or `XAI_API_KEY` yet. Expect
> rough edges and report issues.

shunt ships a built-in `xai` provider (`kind = "responses"`, `base_url = https://api.x.ai/v1`).
It defaults to the **API-key** path; flip it to `xai_oauth` to reuse a **SuperGrok / X Premium+**
subscription. Full spec: [`m6-xai-provider.md`](m6-xai-provider.md).

**API key** (default) — just export the key and add routes:

```toml
# built-in defaults already define [providers.xai]; you only add routes
[[routes]]
model = "grok-4.6"          # current frontier model
provider = "xai"

[[routes]]
model = "grok-build-0.1"    # flagship coding model
provider = "xai"
```

```bash
export XAI_API_KEY=xai-...
```

**Subscription OAuth** — flip the provider's `auth` and log in once with the device-code flow:

```toml
[providers.xai]
auth = "xai_oauth"          # reuse the SuperGrok / X Premium+ login instead of a key
# base_url stays https://api.x.ai/v1 — shunt refuses xai_oauth on a non-x.ai or non-https host

[[routes]]
model = "grok-4.6"
provider = "xai"

[[routes]]
model = "grok-build-0.1"
provider = "xai"
```

```bash
shunt login xai            # prints a URL + code; approve in any browser
```

`shunt login xai` runs the RFC 8628 device-code flow: it prints a verification URL and short
code, you approve in a browser (on any device — no loopback port needed, so it works over
SSH/VPS/Docker), and it saves `~/.shunt/xai-auth.json` (override with `SHUNT_XAI_AUTH_FILE`).
shunt refreshes the token automatically. A **403** on refresh means the account isn't entitled to
xAI API access (a subscription-tier gate) — shunt says so distinctly and points you at the
`XAI_API_KEY` path rather than telling you to re-login; a **400/401** tells you to run
`shunt login xai` again.

> **Reasoning effort is opt-in for grok.** Several grok models reject `reasoning.effort` with a
> 400, so shunt sends the reasoning dial only when an effort was explicitly chosen — an `effort` on the route or provider, or a per-request `output_config.effort` from the client
> (e.g. `effort = "high"` under `[providers.xai]` or a `[[routes]]` entry). Without it, grok
> reasons on its own and shunt sends no `reasoning` object.

### 5.4 Select a mapped model (primary path)

Claude Code's model-discovery only honors ids beginning with `claude`/`anthropic`, so for
OpenAI/Codex ids (`gpt-*`) use `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` — it adds a picker entry whose id
skips validation:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION="gpt-5.6-sol"
```

Then pick it from `/model` in Claude Code. That id is what shunt routes on, so it must resolve
through a matching `[models.upstream_model]` entry, `[[routes]]`, or `[[route_prefixes]]` rule in
your config.

**The two picker-exposure methods split cleanly on the `claude-`/`anthropic-` prefix — they don't
overlap.** Discovery honors *only* `claude-`/`anthropic-` ids; `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` and
the `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` window override apply *only* to ids that do **not** start with
that prefix. The consequence: a `claude-…-via-codex` discovery alias is convenient (auto-listed,
one-tap selectable) but its context window is **stuck at the 200k default** — the override can't
reach a `claude-`-prefixed id (§5.8).

| What | `claude-`/`anthropic-` id (discovery alias) | non-`claude-` id (e.g. `gpt-5.6-sol`) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `/v1/models` discovery → `/model` picker | ✅ auto-listed ("From gateway"), many models | ❌ dropped by Claude Code |
| `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` | ❌ not honored | ✅ adds to picker (**one id only**) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` window | ❌ ignored → 200k default | ✅ applies → set the real window (e.g. 372k) |

So choose by priority: the **discovery alias** for picker convenience across several models (accept
the conservative 200k denominator), or a **non-`claude-` id via `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION`** for
an accurate window, one model at a time. (Subagents are a separate path — see below.)

> **Model slugs:** the ChatGPT-account Codex backend **rejects** `gpt-*-codex` slugs (e.g.
> `gpt-5.2-codex`) — it only accepts the account's live-entitled slugs. The authoritative catalog
> of Codex slugs (and the reasoning levels each accepts) is openai/codex's
> [`codex-rs/models-manager/models.json`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/models-manager/models.json).
> The current listed slugs are **`gpt-6-astra`** (latest), **`gpt-5.6-sol`**, **`gpt-5.6-terra`**,
> **`gpt-5.6-luna`** (frontier), and **`gpt-5.5`** / **`gpt-5.4`** / **`gpt-5.4-mini`** /
> **`gpt-5.2`**; older accounts may only be entitled to the earlier ones. Use `upstream_model` in
> a route, or pass an entitled slug via `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION`. See [`m2-chatgpt-oauth.md`](m2-chatgpt-oauth.md) §0.

> **Client-version gating:** some slugs additionally carry a `minimal_client_version` (e.g.
> `gpt-6-astra` requires ≥ 0.153.0) and the backend answers **`Model not found <slug>`** — not
> an entitlement error — when the request's client identity is missing or too old. The gate keys
> on the `originator` + `version` headers ([openai/codex#31967](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/31967)).
> shunt therefore sends the Codex CLI identity headers (`originator: codex_cli_rs`,
> `version`, and a matching `user-agent`) on ChatGPT OAuth requests, **pinned to
> openai/codex rust-v0.153.3**. If a future slug demands a newer client, bump the pinned
> version in `src/adapters/responses/request.rs` (`CODEX_USER_AGENT` / `CODEX_CLIENT_VERSION`).

Per-context selection also works via Claude Code's own knobs — divert one agent to a mapped model
while the main session stays on Claude:

- **A named subagent's `model:` frontmatter** (`.claude/agents/<name>.md`) is the only way to put a
  subagent on a `gpt-*` id: that field accepts any string, whereas the Agent/Task tool's `model`
  parameter is restricted to the built-in aliases (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`/`fable`) and cannot take
  a gateway id. Spawn the agent by its type **without** a `model` override — the tool parameter
  outranks frontmatter (resolution order: `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` > tool `model` > frontmatter
  > `inherit`), so passing one would shadow the mapped model.
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`** forces every subagent onto one model (global).

The context window follows the model automatically: `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` (§5.8) is keyed
on the id, so one global value sizes the mapped subagent (e.g. 372k) while the Claude main keeps its
own — no per-subagent env is needed, and the same overflow/compact behavior (§5.8) applies.

Verify named-subagent routing at both ownership boundaries. Claude Code's stream-JSON Agent result
records the client-side selection as `agentType` + `resolvedModel`; this field requires Claude Code
2.1.174 or newer, and no output on an older client is not evidence that routing fell back. For an
exact `[[routes]]` entry, shunt's `GET /routes` records the gateway-side `model` → `provider` /
`upstream_model` mapping:

```bash
claude --output-format stream-json --verbose -p \
  "Use the researcher agent once without a model override, then stop." \
  | jq -Rr '
      fromjson?
      | .tool_use_result?
      | objects
      | select(.resolvedModel?)
      | [(.agentType // null), .resolvedModel]
      | @tsv
    '

# `GET /routes` exposes exact `[[routes]]` entries only; it does not expand
# `[[route_prefixes]]`.
curl -s "${ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL%/}/routes" \
  | jq '.data[] | select(.model == "gpt-5.6-sol")'
```

Diagnose in that order: a `resolvedModel` that differs from the agent's frontmatter means Claude
Code chose a different model ID before shunt saw the request (check the global env override,
tool-level override, and agent frontmatter, then inspect the matching exact route because shunt may
intentionally remap that ID); a correct `resolvedModel` with a wrong exact `/routes` entry is shunt
configuration. For a prefix-routed ID, inspect the active `[[route_prefixes]]` entry instead, then
send a minimal request through that ID to exercise the effective route. Correct client-side and
gateway-side evidence points to provider auth, entitlement, quota, or compatibility. Do not use
model self-identification as routing evidence.

### 5.5 (Optional) Model discovery

Discovery (`GET /v1/models`) can populate `/model` automatically — **but Claude Code ignores
any id that doesn't begin with `claude`/`anthropic`** ([protocol
reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway-protocol#model-discovery)). So a `gpt-*`
id is dropped client-side no matter what; discovery is only useful when you expose a
**Claude-named alias**. The alias can route and translate directly through a single-provider
`[models.upstream_model]` table:

```toml
[[models]]
id = "claude-gpt-5.6-sol-via-codex"     # must begin with claude/anthropic
display_name = "GPT-5.6-Sol (via Codex)"

[models.upstream_model]
codex = "gpt-5.6-sol"                   # provider = real upstream slug
```

This map takes precedence over `[[routes]]`, `[[route_prefixes]]`, and `server.default_provider`
for the advertised id. It must name exactly one configured provider; an unknown provider, an empty
or multi-provider map, or a same-id `[[routes]]` entry is a startup error. Existing map-less
`[[models]]` entries can continue to use a separate route:

```toml
[[models]]
id = "claude-gpt-5.6-sol-via-codex"
display_name = "GPT-5.6-Sol (via Codex)"

[[routes]]
model = "claude-gpt-5.6-sol-via-codex"
provider = "codex"
upstream_model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
```

Then enable discovery (Claude Code v2.1.129+) and restart shunt + Claude Code:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1
```

The alias appears in `/model` labeled *From gateway*; selecting it sends
`claude-gpt-5.6-sol-via-codex`, which shunt routes to `codex` and rewrites to `gpt-5.6-sol`. Discovery
fails **silently** (3-second timeout, any redirect counts as failure) and falls back to the
cached/built-in list — run `claude --debug` and look for `[gatewayDiscovery]` lines to confirm
it ran. For `gpt-*` ids without an alias, use `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` (§5.4) instead.
See [`m3-discovery.md`](m3-discovery.md).

> **Discovery needs a gateway credential — a claude.ai OAuth *login* alone won't trigger it.**
> Claude Code only issues the `/v1/models` request when `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, an API key, or an

> correctly, but the request never left Claude Code until a token was set. See §5.2 for choosing
> the credential — `claude setup-token` is the recommended route.

### 5.6 Reasoning effort

Claude Code's effort level (`/effort`, the `/model` slider, `--effort`, or
`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`) is sent as the `output_config.effort` request field, and shunt maps
it to the Responses `reasoning.effort` for mapped models:

| Claude Code effort | → `reasoning.effort` |
| :-- | :-- |
| `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` | passthrough |
| `max` | passthrough on models that accept it (the **gpt-5.6** and **gpt-6** families), else folded to `xhigh` |

Which reasoning levels a Codex slug accepts is listed per-model in openai/codex's
[`models.json`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/models-manager/models.json)
(`supported_reasoning_levels`): `gpt-5.6-sol`/`-terra`/`-luna` and the gpt-6 slugs (e.g.
`gpt-6-astra`) accept up to `max` — `sol`/`terra`/`astra` even `ultra`, which Claude Code never
sends and `gpt-5.6-luna` does not list — while `gpt-5.5`/`5.4`/`5.2` cap at `xhigh`. shunt folds
`max → xhigh` only for slugs that don't support it.

**A custom gateway id like `gpt-5.6-sol` carries effort on its own.** Verified on the wire against Claude Code v2.1.224: the request already
includes `output_config.effort` with `CLAUDE_CODE_ALWAYS_ENABLE_EFFORT` unset, and setting it to `1`
produces a byte-identical request. The flag applies to non-first-party providers (Bedrock, Vertex,
Foundry, gateway login), not to a plain `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` setup.

Effort is instead lost on ids the client normalizes onto its legacy effort deny list
(`claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`): those send no `output_config.effort` at all, no
environment variable overrides it, and shunt falls back to `medium`.

Precedence in shunt: a config `route.effort` / `[providers.*].effort` override wins first;
otherwise the request's `output_config.effort` is honored; otherwise `thinking.enabled → high`,
then a model-name suffix (`-xhigh`/`-high`/`-medium`/`-low`, with `-spark` treated as `-low`), else `medium`.

### 5.7 (Optional) Attribution block

Claude Code prepends an attribution line to the system prompt
(`x-anthropic-billing-header: cc_version=…; cc_entrypoint=cli;`). Anthropic strips it before
processing, but shunt forwards it unchanged, so a mapped provider such as the ChatGPT Codex
backend receives it as the first line of `instructions`. It's harmless (requests still succeed)
but meaningless noise for a non-Anthropic model. To drop it:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_HEADER=0
```

This is global, so it also removes attribution from any Anthropic-passthrough traffic (used for
cost tracking) — which is fine when you're routing to another provider.

### 5.8 Context / usage display for mapped models

Claude Code's statusline and prompt footer compute the **context indicator locally** from the
assistant message's token `usage` (`input_tokens + cache_read + cache_creation`) divided by the
model's context-window size — no server field controls it. Two consequences for models routed to
a `responses` provider (codex/OpenAI):

- **Token count (the numerator) is accurate.** shunt reads `input_tokens` (and cached tokens) from
  the Responses `usage` and forwards them in the Anthropic `message_delta`, so the bar fills as the
  conversation grows. (The OpenAI `input_tokens` total includes cached tokens; shunt peels the
  cached part into `cache_read_input_tokens`, preserving the total.)
- **The window (the denominator) defaults to a fixed 200k for unmapped ids.**
  `getContextWindowForModel` returns `200_000` for any model id it doesn't recognize, and its
  accurate per-model lookup (`max_input_tokens` from the gateway's `/v1/models`) is **disabled
  unless the base URL is `api.anthropic.com`** — so a gateway can't set it. A model with a larger
  real window (e.g. `gpt-5.6-sol` at 372k) therefore shows a **conservative, over-reported**
  percentage. This only makes Claude Code's auto-compact trigger a little early; it is otherwise
  harmless.

The 200k default **can be overridden client-side** with `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`
(verified in Claude Code 2.1.205): the window function uses this value for any model id that does
**not** start with `claude-`, which is exactly the mapped-model case:

```bash
# e.g. gpt-5.6-sol's real window
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=372000
```

Caveats: it is **global** — one value for every non-`claude-` model in the session, so it can't be
set per-model when routing models with different window sizes — and setting it **larger than the
real upstream window** means auto-compact won't trigger in time, so requests overflow the real
limit. On the streaming path Claude Code actually uses, the ChatGPT/Codex backend surfaces a
`prompt is too long` error mid-stream, which shunt's context-overflow rewrite normalizes
(`context_overflow_message`, `src/model/responses.rs`) and Claude Code auto-compacts + retries on —
so the session recovers, but every overflow round-trip
is wasted latency. Match it to the **smallest real window** among your mapped models to avoid the
churn. (Live-verified for `gpt-5.6-sol`: 365k tokens answers normally, 372k+ overflows — the
boundary is its `models.json` `context_window` of 372000; `gpt-5.5` is 272000. A *non*-streaming
request instead degrades to an empty `200` with `input_tokens: 0`, but the main loop always
streams.) Claude passthrough models
(`claude-*` ids) ignore it and keep their exact built-in sizes. (With `DISABLE_COMPACT` also set,
the value applies unconditionally — `claude-*` ids included.) This same `claude-` gate is why a
**discovery alias** (which must begin with `claude-`, §5.4) can't take this override — its window
stays pinned at the 200k default: safe (auto-compact fires early) but not raisable to the model's
real size without `DISABLE_COMPACT`. Use a non-`claude-` id when you need the accurate window.

The other client-side lever is the `[1m]` model-id suffix, which forces a **1M** window — useful
for a genuinely 1M-context model, but misleading (under-reporting) for a smaller one, so avoid it
unless the upstream really has that window. shunt strips a trailing `[1m]` from the model id before
route matching and before forwarding upstream (`routing.rs`), so `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]` (or a
`claude-…-via-codex[1m]` discovery alias) still routes correctly and the provider never sees the
suffix — the hint stays purely client-side.

| Field | Mapped (`responses`) model | Claude passthrough |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Context tokens used | ✅ accurate (forwarded by shunt) | ✅ accurate |
| Context window (denominator) | ⚠️ 200k default; set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` (or `[1m]` → 1M) | ✅ exact |
| `count_tokens` (pre-flight) | ⚠️ client `char/4`, or `count_tokens = "tiktoken"` for a closer local count (§4) | ✅ exact (upstream) |
| `rate_limits` (5h / weekly) | ❌ needs Anthropic `anthropic-ratelimit-*` headers | ✅ shown |

### 5.9 (Optional) Shared-gateway client tokens

By default shunt has no inbound auth — fine for a loopback-only personal gateway, but once
you share it over a VPN/tunnel, anyone who can reach it can spend the **operator's** account
on mapped models (shunt injects its own `api_key`/`chatgpt_oauth` credential for those).
Passthrough models are not the concern: they forward each caller's own Anthropic credential.

`[server.auth]` gates injected-credential routes and model discovery with per-client tokens
(spec: [`m4-inbound-auth.md`](m4-inbound-auth.md)):

```toml
[server.auth]                        # both keys optional; defaults shown
header = "x-shunt-token"
tokens_env = "SHUNT_CLIENT_TOKENS"
```

```bash
# Gateway side: name:token pairs (names are labels for logging; tokens are secrets)
export SHUNT_CLIENT_TOKENS="minsu:$(openssl rand -hex 32),alice:$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
```

Startup **fails closed** if `[server.auth]` is present but the env var is unset or
malformed. Requests to mapped models and `GET /v1/models` without a valid token get a 401
`authentication_error`. Both gates accept the client token in any standard Anthropic
credential slot — the configured header (default `x-shunt-token`), `Authorization: Bearer`,
or `x-api-key`, in that priority when several carry valid tokens. `GET /routes`,
`GET|HEAD /`, `GET /health`, and passthrough models
stay open. `GET /routes` remains unauthenticated because it is a shunt-native endpoint exposing
routing metadata (the configured provider/upstream-model mapping), never credentials, which live
only in provider config and are never read by that handler.
On gated routes the accepted credential headers are always stripped before forwarding,
matching is constant-time, and token values are never logged (client *names* are, per request).
A passthrough route injects nothing and forwards the caller's own credential as presented,
except per slot: `authorization` and `x-api-key` are each cleared when that slot's own value is
one of shunt's own inbound credentials (an accepted client token, or a `[server.gateway]` JWT),
so a credential accepted at the gate is never relayed upstream while a genuine upstream
credential in the other slot keeps flowing (`docs/m4-inbound-auth.md` §2).

Client side, on a **pool/mapped-only** gateway (e.g. `claude_oauth` as the default provider)
the client token can simply *be* the Anthropic credential Claude Code already sends:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="<your client token>"   # sent as Authorization: Bearer
```

When the gateway also serves **passthrough** models, the caller's real Anthropic credential
needs a slot of its own, so hand out dedicated tokens in the configured header and keep
`authorization` / `x-api-key` free for it (`ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` takes one `Name: Value`
per line). This is hygiene rather than the only thing preventing a leak: a client token that
does arrive in `authorization` or `x-api-key` is cleared from that slot by value before any
passthrough forward.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS="x-shunt-token: <your token>"
```

This is application-layer identification only — transport encryption still comes from the
deployment (WireGuard/Tailscale tunnel, or TLS termination in front); shunt itself serves
plain HTTP.

### 5.10 SSE keepalive pings (Cloudflare 524 survival)

Middleboxes kill quiet streams — Cloudflare's proxy returns **524 after 100 seconds without
a byte** (fixed below Enterprise), and long reasoning stretches can be silent that long.
shunt therefore injects the Anthropic protocol's own `ping` event (which api.anthropic.com
itself emits and every client ignores) whenever a streaming response has been idle:

```toml
[server]
sse_keepalive_seconds = 30   # default; 0 disables
```

Pings are injected only between complete SSE events (never inside a half-sent frame), only
on `text/event-stream` responses, and stop with the upstream stream. Behind a tunnel with
no idle timeout (WireGuard/Tailscale) the pings are harmless; disable with `0` if you want
byte-identical relaying. Spec: [`m5-sse-keepalive.md`](m5-sse-keepalive.md).

## 6. Verify

**1. Test the gateway directly** (proves the URL + routing work before opening Claude Code):

```bash
# Unmapped model -> forwarded to Anthropic (uses your Anthropic credential)
curl -s -X POST "$ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":1,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"."}]}'

# Mapped model -> diverted to the provider (uses shunt's provider credential)
curl -s -X POST "$ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-5.6-sol","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

A JSON response starting with `{"id":"msg_` means it worked.

**2. Confirm inside Claude Code:** start `claude` from the same shell, run `/status`, and check
the **Anthropic base URL** line shows `http://127.0.0.1:3001`. Then open `/model` and pick your
mapped model.

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / Fix |
| :------ | :---------- |
| `ChatGPT auth not found; run codex login` | shunt can't read `~/.codex/auth.json`. Run `codex login`. |
| `authentication_error` on a mapped model | Expired/absent provider credential — re-run `codex login`, or export `OPENAI_API_KEY`. shunt surfaces the backend's real `detail` message. |
| `400 ... model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account` | You used a `-codex` slug (or one your account isn't entitled to). Use an entitled slug from [models.json](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/models-manager/models.json) (e.g. `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.5`) or set `upstream_model`. |
| `/model` doesn't list your model | For `gpt-*` ids use `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION`; discovery only surfaces `claude`/`anthropic`-prefixed ids. |
| `config check failed` | Run `shunt check` for the exact reason (bind address, unknown provider in a route, wrong adapter/auth). |
| Claude Code asks you to log in | Set an Anthropic credential (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` / login) that shunt can forward for unmapped models. A base URL alone is not a credential. |
