# M11 — Inbound Codex endpoint (Codex CLI → shunt account pool)

M11 adds an opt-in **inbound** OpenAI Responses (Codex) endpoint so the OpenAI **Codex CLI**
itself can point its `base_url` at shunt and be load-balanced across a pool of ChatGPT/Codex OAuth
accounts. Every prior milestone routes traffic the other direction: [M1](m1-responses-translation.md)
translates *Claude Code's* Anthropic Messages requests into the Responses shape shunt sends
upstream, and [M10](m10-codex-multi-account.md) pools the accounts that outbound path uses. M11
is the reverse-facing counterpart — a Codex CLI client talks the Responses protocol directly to
shunt. Native Responses targets relay it unchanged; an exact Anthropic target uses the strict
translation contract below and the existing Anthropic transport machinery.

## Contrast with `/v1/messages`

The existing `/v1/messages` path (Claude Code → shunt → Codex) and this endpoint (Codex CLI →
shunt → Codex) share an upstream but differ in kind:

| | `/v1/messages` (outbound, existing) | inbound Codex endpoint (this milestone) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Inbound client | Claude Code (Anthropic Messages) | OpenAI Codex CLI (OpenAI Responses) |
| Inbound → upstream body | **Translated**: `translate_request` builds a Responses body from the Anthropic Messages request | Native Responses targets pass through; exact Anthropic targets translate Responses into Messages |
| Upstream → outbound response | **Re-shaped**: `AnthropicSseMachine` turns Responses SSE into Anthropic SSE (or a single Anthropic JSON body) | Native targets pass through; Anthropic JSON/SSE is projected into Responses JSON/events |
| On pool exhaustion | Re-shapes the last upstream response into an Anthropic-style error envelope (`build_upstream_error`) | Native Responses errors relay unchanged; Anthropic errors use the Responses error envelope and retain safe retry/request metadata |
| Model selects provider? | Yes, via `[models.upstream_model]` / `[[routes]]` / `[[route_prefixes]]` | Exact unambiguous `[models.upstream_model]`/`[[routes]]` declarations may select one Responses-native or Anthropic provider; prefix-only, non-exact, and unmatched models use the pinned endpoint provider |

Native routes continue to share the M10 account pool, session-sticky selection, cooldowns, and
refresh unchanged. Exact Anthropic routes instead reuse the configured Anthropic adapter's own
credential and account behavior.

## Configuration

A new opt-in `[server.codex_endpoint]` table, mirroring the [M9](m9-admin-surface.md)
`[server.admin]` opt-in pattern:

```toml
[server.codex_endpoint]
provider = "codex"   # default; the target chatgpt_oauth provider
collaboration = false # opt in to the translated V2 collaboration bridge
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `provider` | `"codex"` | Which `chatgpt_oauth` provider's account pool serves inbound Responses requests. |
| `collaboration` | `false` | Allow exact Anthropic routes to translate declared V2 collaboration tools and plaintext agent tasks. Native Responses routes remain opaque regardless of this flag. |

**Absent ⇒ none of the routes are registered** — the default HTTP surface is unchanged. Present ⇒
config validation requires the named provider to exist and use `auth = "chatgpt_oauth"`; otherwise
shunt fails to start with a `ConfigError` naming the problem (unknown provider, or wrong auth
mode). This is the same bearer-leak discipline M8/M10 apply elsewhere: only a `chatgpt_oauth`
provider has the Codex OAuth injection this endpoint depends on.

## Routes

When opted in, shunt registers three Responses routes, all mapping to one inbound dispatcher:

| Method | Path |
| :-- | :-- |
| `GET` (WebSocket), `POST` | `/backend-api/codex/responses` |
| `GET` (WebSocket), `POST` | `/responses` |
| `GET` (WebSocket), `POST` | `/v1/responses` |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses/compact` |

Three Responses paths exist because the Codex CLI always appends `/responses` to whatever `base_url` it is
pointed at: a base ending in `/backend-api/codex` produces `/backend-api/codex/responses` (the
literal path the real ChatGPT backend uses), a base ending in `/v1` produces `/v1/responses`, and
a bare base produces `/responses`. Registering all three lets an operator use either CLI setup
style (§ "Codex CLI setup" below) without shunt needing to know which one a given client chose.

`POST /v1/responses/compact` is the HTTP-only remote-compaction surface. It requires a valid,
non-empty string `model`, applies the same inbound authentication and request limits, and forwards
the original request bytes through the same native route and account-pool machinery. Only the
ChatGPT/Codex backend and the canonical official OpenAI API are treated as verified native compact
destinations; unsupported, ambiguous, translated, or non-Responses routes return an OpenAI-shaped
`400` before credential resolution or network dispatch. shunt treats `input`,
`previous_response_id`, and encrypted continuation fields as opaque: it neither decrypts nor
rewrites them and stores no request history or compacted summary.

### WebSocket transport

An authenticated `GET` WebSocket upgrade is available on the same three paths. Authentication is
checked before the `101 Switching Protocols` response. Each socket permits one active turn:
`response.create` starts a turn through the same account-pool dispatcher as HTTP, a replacement
`response.create` cancels the prior upstream body, and closing the socket cancels the active turn.
`response.processed` is an acknowledgement no-op. A `response.create` with `generate: false` is
answered locally with empty-id `response.created` and `response.completed` frames and makes no
upstream request.

Successful upstream SSE `data:` payloads are forwarded as WebSocket text without JSON
reserialization through the first `response.completed`, `response.failed`, or
`response.incomplete`. Client messages and individual upstream SSE events are limited to 4 MiB;
the internal output queue holds one frame and every send is awaited. Premature EOF, malformed SSE
JSON, and upstream failures become standalone `type: "error"` frames. Their optional `headers`
object contains only Responses-safe request IDs, retry/rate-limit metadata, and `x-codex-*`
metadata—never cookies, credentials, hop-by-hop, or Shunt-owned headers.

### Client analytics sink

The same opt-in also registers `POST /backend-api/codex/analytics-events/events` and
`POST /codex/analytics-events/events`, covering the default ChatGPT-style and root-style
`chatgpt_base_url` forms. The Codex CLI posts JSON batches shaped as
`{"events":[{"event_type":"...","event_params":{...}}]}`. shunt authenticates these routes the
same way as the Responses routes, accepts the body, and always returns `200` with `{}` after the
auth check. It never forwards the batch: selecting one pooled account would misattribute the
client's product telemetry to that account.

The body and event properties are discarded without logging or export. Only a per-event-name
`shunt.codex_client_events` counter is emitted to the already opt-in Sentry/OpenTelemetry metric
sinks. Event names are limited to 64 bytes and to lowercase ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and
`-`; invalid names become `other`, while malformed or unrecognized batches are counted once as
`unparsed`. Oversized or unreadable bodies also succeed and are counted as `unparsed`. With no
metric sink configured, these routes are pure discard sinks.

## Exact routing, translation, and pinned fallback

The inbound endpoint keeps `[server.codex_endpoint].provider` as its compatibility default. The
bounded decoded `model` value is used only to look up an **exact** existing
`[models.upstream_model]` or legacy `[[routes]]` declaration. A unique declaration may select a
single `kind = "responses"` provider, where the original request and response bytes remain
unchanged, or a single `kind = "anthropic"` provider, where the request and response are translated
under the contract below. Prefix-only matches (`[[route_prefixes]]`), non-exact values, missing or
malformed model fields, and unmatched models all use the pinned provider. An exact declaration
that is ambiguous or maps to another adapter is rejected before any upstream request, rather than
silently guessing or hopping providers.

HTTP and WebSocket turns use this same resolver. Provider-aware credentials and hop-by-hop/header
filtering remain gateway responsibilities, while native payloads stay opaque. Once response body
bytes (or a WebSocket response event) are observable, there is no post-output provider hop; only
provider-local account rotation before output may occur.

Reading that label has to account for compression. Current Codex releases zstd-compress the
Responses request body whenever they talk to the ChatGPT backend, which is true of the
`chatgpt_base_url` client shape pointed at this endpoint (issue #285). The compressed bytes relay
upstream unchanged — `content-encoding` is not stripped — but they are not JSON, so the label parse
decodes an in-memory copy first (bounded by the same 64 MiB cap the endpoint already applies to an
uncompressed body). If the body still cannot be read — an undecodable frame, an over-cap expansion,
or a content coding shunt does not decode — the request relays normally and only the label degrades
to `unknown`, with a `warn` naming the reason. It is never silently swallowed: an unexplained
`model="unknown"` on every metric, log line, and span was the original symptom.

## Native passthrough

On a Responses-native route, the inbound body is forwarded upstream **byte-for-byte** — no
model/effort resolution and no field rewriting. The upstream response is relayed back
**verbatim**: the status code and (almost) every upstream response header are preserved unchanged,
so an SSE reply stays `text/event-stream`, a non-streaming reply stays a single `application/json`
body, and headers like `retry-after` and `x-codex-turn-state` reach the CLI untouched. There is no
`AnthropicSseMachine`, no keepalive-ping injection, and no error re-shaping on a normal request —
the Codex CLI speaks the same wire protocol to shunt that it would speak directly to
`chatgpt.com`. The Anthropic branch below does not alter this path.

## Exact Anthropic translation

A unique exact route to `kind = "anthropic"` translates before credential resolution and network
dispatch. Accepted Responses input covers instructions, user/assistant text, URL and data-URL
images, paired function calls and outputs, function-tool schemas and tool choice, parallel-tool
policy, generation controls, and supported reasoning effort. The translator rejects duplicate or
malformed structures, `previous_response_id`, encrypted reasoning or compaction state, hosted or
custom tools, remote file ids, orphaned tool results, and any input whose meaning cannot be
preserved. `POST /v1/responses/compact` remains native-only.

The request then uses the normal Anthropic adapter, including its configured authentication,
account selection, refresh, retry, TTFB timeout, admission, and safe header filtering. The response
translator is shared by HTTP and WebSocket. It converts Anthropic text, tool use, and thinking into
Responses output items and emits bounded, ordered SSE events with stable ids, monotonic sequence
numbers, and one terminal event. `end_turn`, `stop_sequence`, and `tool_use` become completed;
`max_tokens` becomes incomplete. Malformed content, invalid tool JSON, unknown stop reasons,
upstream stream errors, and EOF before `message_stop` become failed rather than false success.
Usage input totals include ordinary, cache-read, and cache-creation tokens. Anthropic thinking
signatures are neither relabeled as OpenAI encrypted state nor persisted.

When `collaboration = true`, exact Anthropic routes additionally accept the V2
`collaboration` namespace from top-level `tools` and `additional_tools`, plus plaintext
`agent_message` task envelopes. Declared tools are flattened to a collision-checked private wire
name and only authorized response calls are restored to `namespace = "collaboration"` with
`encrypted_function_args = []`. `metadata.task_id` is carried as Anthropic `metadata.user_id`, and
the JSON Schema annotation `encrypted: true` is removed only where it is schema metadata—not from
properties or literal values named `encrypted`. The flag does not parse or rewrite native
Responses traffic.

This bridge is deliberately not a recovery service. A translated task containing only a
structurally valid encrypted payload, or any translated `previous_response_id`/provider state,
fails before credential resolution or network dispatch. shunt does not decrypt, cache, persist, or
make a hidden billable request to recover that state; callers must supply plaintext history or use
a native Responses route.

### Header passthrough

Because the inbound client **is** a real Codex CLI (unlike the `/v1/messages` path, where shunt
*impersonates* one), the passthrough forwards the client's **own request headers verbatim** rather
than synthesizing them. shunt's translating path builds a fresh request with a hardcoded Codex
identity (`originator=codex_cli_rs`, `user-agent=codex_cli_rs/0.153.3`, `version=0.153.3`,
`OpenAI-Beta: responses=experimental`, and session/window headers derived from the session id); the
inbound passthrough does **not** — it forwards whatever `version`, `originator`, `user-agent`,
`OpenAI-Beta`, `session-id`, `thread-id`, `x-codex-window-id`, `x-codex-*`, `content-type`, and
`accept` the Codex CLI sent, so the client's **real** version drives the backend's
`minimal_client_version` model gating (see
[`codex-configuration.md` §5](codex-configuration.md#5-model-slugs)) exactly as if it were talking
to `chatgpt.com`. The only request headers shunt changes are:

- **Swapped in** per selected pool account: `Authorization: Bearer <account>` and
  `chatgpt-account-id` (replacing whatever the client sent).
- **Stripped**: the shunt client-token header (the default `x-shunt-token` is stripped unconditionally
  — even on an ungated endpoint, or one using a custom auth header — so it never leaks upstream),
  the client's own `Authorization`/`chatgpt-account-id` (replaced above), `x-api-key` (stripped
  unconditionally too on the native branch — the pinned provider is validated `chatgpt_oauth`-only at boot, so no inbound
  `x-api-key` value can ever be a valid upstream credential; a client that sets both `Authorization`
  and `x-api-key` to the same key, as Claude Code's `apiKeyHelper` does, must not have the second slot
  leak the first slot's secret), `accept-encoding` (so the
  upstream body stays uncompressed for a clean byte relay), and framing/hop-by-hop headers the HTTP
  client recomputes (`host`, `content-length`, `connection`, …).

On the response side, framing/hop-by-hop headers (`content-length`, `content-encoding`,
`transfer-encoding`, `connection`, …) are dropped so axum can frame the streamed body, and
`set-cookie`/`set-cookie2` are dropped so an upstream/edge session cookie (e.g. Cloudflare
`__cf_bm`/`cf_clearance`) bound to shunt's server-side egress is never leaked to the untrusted
inbound client (CWE-200/CWE-201); every other upstream header is relayed verbatim.

## Inbound authentication

Gated by `[server.auth]`, because the provider injects a server-side Codex bearer that must not be
handed to an unauthenticated caller. The client presents the shunt client token **either** through
the configured header (default `x-shunt-token`) **or** as an OpenAI-style `Authorization: Bearer
<token>` — the `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `env_key` idiom the Codex CLI (and LiteLLM/llmgateway proxy setups)
use, so no custom header is required. Both are checked by `InboundAuth::authenticate_bearer` (the
`/v1/messages` path uses the header-only `authenticate`; only this endpoint additionally accepts the
Bearer form, since its client is a Codex CLI). Without a configured `[server.auth]`, the endpoint is
open — acceptable for loopback or personal use, not for a shared gateway.

Critically, the client's `Authorization: Bearer` header is **never forwarded upstream**, whatever it
carries: if it holds the shunt client token it authenticates the request (via `authenticate_bearer`
above) and is then stripped; if it holds anything else (e.g. the Codex CLI's own ChatGPT credential)
it fails the inbound check and is likewise stripped. The shunt client-token header is **stripped**
too, and so is `x-api-key` — unconditionally, whether or not `[server.auth]` is configured, since the
  gate never reads that header and the native upstream is `chatgpt_oauth`-only — so neither the shunt token
nor the client's own credential, in either slot, ever leaks to the backend. The passthrough forwards the
Codex CLI's own request headers verbatim (see [Header passthrough](#header-passthrough) below) but
**swaps in only** the selected pool account's `Authorization` bearer + `chatgpt-account-id` — see
[`codex-configuration.md` §4.4](codex-configuration.md#4-authentication-codexauthjson). Nothing
about the client's own credential reaches the Codex backend.

## Native account pool reuse (M10)

Session-sticky quota-aware selection (issue #195), reactive failover, cooldowns, storm control, per-account refresh, and identity coalescing are all reused unchanged from [M10](m10-codex-multi-account.md) — this endpoint adds no new pool logic, only a new entry point into it. Account resolution goes through the shared `resolve_pool_accounts` path: configured entries are used directly, while an empty list uses the store directory-mtime cache and fills each scanned account's stable identity from its Codex `account_id`. The existing empty-store single-account fallback remains unchanged.

- **Sticky key.** The Codex CLI's own `session-id` request header selects the sticky account (same
  hashing scheme as M10), falling back to `x-claude-code-session-id` for parity with the outbound
  path. Same session id → same account, for as long as that account stays healthy. When
  `[server.auth]` is configured, the sticky key is namespaced with the authenticated client name
  (`{client}:{session-id}`, mirroring the outbound path) so that on a multi-tenant gateway one
  client cannot pin another client's session onto a chosen account by replaying its `session-id`.
- **Failover** follows M10's rules exactly: every `429` rotates (cooldown = `retry-after` clamped
  1–3600s, default 60s); a `5xx` or transport failure cools the account for 30s and rotates; a
  `401` on a refreshable (store/`credentials`) account triggers a force-refresh and one retry (5
  minutes + rotate if still failing); a `401` on a `token_env` account (not refreshable) cools for
  5 minutes and rotates; an unresolvable credential cools for 5 minutes and rotates.
- **Success.** A successful pooled response clears that account's cooldown and carries an
  `x-shunt-account: <name>` response header, same as the outbound path — use a neutral account
  label on a shared gateway (see M10's header note).

## Exhaustion behavior (differs from `/v1/messages`)

On a native Responses route, when every account in the pool has been tried and **at least one** upstream response was
received, shunt relays the **last** upstream response **verbatim** — status and body unchanged.
This is the opposite of the `/v1/messages` Codex path, which re-shapes the last response into an
Anthropic-style error envelope (`build_upstream_error`); a passthrough client expects the raw
Responses-shaped body it would have gotten from `chatgpt.com` directly, error or not.

If every account fails **before** any upstream response is received at all (for example, every
account's credentials are unresolvable), there is no real upstream body to relay, so shunt returns
a gateway-owned `502 bad gateway` with the fixed message `all Codex OAuth accounts failed before
receiving an upstream response`.

Every **gateway-owned** error on this endpoint — this 502, the inbound-auth `401`, an oversized or
unreadable request body, a Codex endpoint disabled by hot reload, or an account-store scan failure — is returned
in the **OpenAI Responses error shape** (`{"error":{"message":..,"type":..,"code":null}}`),
preserving its status code, so a Codex CLI (or any OpenAI Responses client) parses it through its
own error path rather than the Anthropic `{"type":"error",...}` envelope shunt uses elsewhere. This
is the one deliberate exception to native byte-for-byte passthrough: relayed native **upstream** errors
(429/4xx/5xx from the backend) still pass through verbatim and unchanged. Anthropic-route upstream
errors are translated to the same OpenAI envelope while retaining safe retry/request headers. Gateway re-shaping happens
once, at the endpoint boundary (`codex_endpoint::post` → `error::into_openai_error_shape`), so the
Anthropic Messages path keeps its own error shape untouched (issue #127).

## Single-account fallback

If the configured provider has no `[[accounts]]` and the account store is also empty, shunt falls
back to the single default `~/.codex/auth.json` / `$CODEX_AUTH_FILE` credential — no pool, no
failover, no `x-shunt-account` header — mirroring M10's existing single-account behavior on the
outbound path. A user with one Codex login therefore works out of the box the moment
`[server.codex_endpoint]` is set, with no account configuration at all.

## Transport: HTTP/SSE and inbound WebSocket

HTTP `POST` remains the byte-for-byte passthrough specified by M11. WebSocket `GET` is an
additional inbound transport and does not depend on the target provider's outbound
`websocket = true` setting; its upstream turn still uses the existing HTTP/SSE account-pool path.

## Reload behavior

Like `[server.admin]`, the route set is decided **once at boot** from the initial config — a
config reload cannot add or drop these routes. A reload *can* change which provider
`[server.codex_endpoint].provider` names; toggling the table on/off at runtime instead logs a
warning that a restart is required to register or drop the routes.

## Codex CLI setup

Point the Codex CLI at shunt with one of two `~/.codex/config.toml` shapes:

**1. Mirror the ChatGPT base URL** (keeps ChatGPT-subscription auth mode in the CLI — the CLI keeps
sending its own ChatGPT credential, so this shape still needs the CLI's local `~/.codex/auth.json`
login and only works against an **ungated** endpoint; with `[server.auth]` set, that ChatGPT bearer
is not the configured shunt token and is rejected, so use shape 2 there):

```toml
chatgpt_base_url = "http://<shunt-host>:3001/backend-api/codex"
```

The CLI appends `/responses`, landing on shunt's `/backend-api/codex/responses` route.

**2. A custom model provider** (selected via the CLI's `model_provider` setting):

```toml
[model_providers.shunt]
base_url = "http://<shunt-host>:3001/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
```

The CLI appends `/responses`, landing on `/v1/responses`.

When `[server.auth]` is configured on shunt, add the shunt client token as a header the CLI sends
— e.g. on the custom `model_providers.shunt` table:

```toml
[model_providers.shunt]
base_url = "http://<shunt-host>:3001/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
http_headers = { "x-shunt-token" = "<token>" }
```

A loopback `base_url` may stay plain `http://` (shunt allows loopback over plaintext); use
`https://` for anything remote. The Codex CLI's own ChatGPT login is irrelevant once pointed at
shunt this way — shunt supplies the account from its own pool, not the CLI's local
`~/.codex/auth.json`. Provision pool accounts the same way as the outbound path:
`shunt login codex --name <name>` (see
[`codex-configuration.md` §13](codex-configuration.md#13-multi-account-pooling)).

## Out of scope / follow-up

- **JSON-success synthesis.** The inbound WebSocket bridge currently expects successful live turns
  to return Responses SSE. Synthesizing event sequences from successful JSON responses is deferred.
- **Model-based provider selection.** The endpoint is pinned to one provider by config; routing
  inbound Responses requests to different providers by `model` (mirroring `[[routes]]`) is not
  implemented and would need its own design (this endpoint has no Anthropic-shaped request to key
  routing decisions off of the way `/v1/messages` does).
- **Admin surface integration.** [M9's](m9-admin-surface.md) dashboard reports `claude_oauth` pool
  health only; extending it to show inbound-Codex-endpoint traffic is a separate follow-up.
