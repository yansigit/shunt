# Codex / ChatGPT provider — configuration reference

How to route Claude Code inference to your **ChatGPT / Codex subscription** through shunt,
reusing the credential the Codex CLI already wrote to `~/.codex/auth.json`. No API key, no
per-token billing — the request is authenticated as your ChatGPT account and answered by the
same backend the `codex` CLI talks to.

This page consolidates every Codex-specific knob. For the broader gateway workflow see
[`running.md`](running.md); for the credential-acquisition spec see

## 1. How it fits together

The `codex` provider is a built-in **`kind = "responses"`** provider: shunt translates Claude
Code's Anthropic Messages request into the OpenAI **Responses API** shape, then sends it to the
ChatGPT-account Codex backend and translates the streamed response back. Three things make it
"Codex" rather than plain OpenAI:

| Aspect | Value | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Upstream endpoint | `<base_url>/codex/responses` | `src/adapters/responses/request.rs` |
| Auth | ChatGPT OAuth from `~/.codex/auth.json` (auto-refreshed) | `src/auth/codex_auth.rs` |
| Responses dialect | `ResponsesFlavor::Chatgpt` — drops params codex never sends | `src/config.rs`, `src/model/responses_request.rs` |

The `Chatgpt` flavor is detected from `auth = "chatgpt_oauth"` (not the provider name), so the
per-backend quirks apply to any provider that uses that auth mode. Notably the ChatGPT backend
**rejects `max_output_tokens`** (`"Unsupported parameter: 'max_output_tokens'"`), so shunt drops
it for this flavor only; it also sends `store: false` and round-trips the encrypted reasoning
blob so chain-of-thought survives across turns.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Log in once with the Codex CLI. shunt reads and refreshes the file it writes — it does **not**
initiate its own login for Codex:

```bash
codex login
```

This creates `~/.codex/auth.json`. If that file is missing, has no tokens, or the refresh token
is gone, shunt returns an `authentication_error` whose message tells you to run `codex login`
again.

---

## 3. The `[providers.codex]` block

The `codex` provider is **built in** — you do not need to declare it at all. This is the full
default; every key shown is the value shunt uses when you omit it:

```toml
[providers.codex]
kind = "responses"                       # translate Anthropic Messages <-> OpenAI Responses
base_url = "https://chatgpt.com/backend-api"  # shunt appends /codex/responses
auth = "chatgpt_oauth"                   # read + auto-refresh ~/.codex/auth.json
# api_key_header = "bearer"              # unused for chatgpt_oauth (bearer is implicit)
# effort = "high"                        # optional default reasoning effort (see §8)
# count_tokens = "tiktoken"              # default; "estimate" opts out (see §11)
# request_compression = true             # default; false sends uncompressed bodies (see §4.5)
```

A partial `[providers.codex]` table overrides **only** the keys it sets — the built-in defaults
fill the rest. Practical uses:

- **Pin a default effort** for everything routed to Codex: `effort = "high"`.
- **Opt out of local token counting**: `count_tokens = "estimate"` (see §11).
- **Point at a different backend host** (rare): change `base_url`. shunt still appends
  `/codex/responses` and still sends the ChatGPT OAuth headers, so the host must be the ChatGPT
  Codex backend.

Keys that do **not** apply to `chatgpt_oauth`: `api_key_env` and `api_key_header` are for
`auth = "api_key"` providers only. The credential comes from the auth file, not the environment.

> **Two accounts, one CLI:** if `~/.codex/auth.json` is in **`ApiKey`** mode (you logged in with
> an OpenAI API key rather than a ChatGPT account), the `codex` provider's OAuth path finds no
> tokens and errors. That API key is instead picked up by the **`openai`** provider as a fallback
> when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset (`src/auth/mod.rs`). The `codex` provider is specifically the
> ChatGPT-subscription path.

---

## 4. Authentication (`~/.codex/auth.json`)

### 4.1 File location

shunt resolves the auth-file path in this order (`default_codex_auth_path`, `src/auth/mod.rs`):

1. `$CODEX_AUTH_FILE` if set — point shunt at a non-standard location (CI, a sandbox, a second
   account).
2. `$HOME/.codex/auth.json`.
3. `.codex/auth.json` relative to the working directory (last-resort fallback).

```bash
# Example: run shunt against an auth file outside the home directory
export CODEX_AUTH_FILE=/etc/shunt/codex-auth.json
```

### 4.2 File schema

shunt reads (and, on refresh, rewrites) this JSON, written by `codex login`:

```jsonc
{
  "auth_mode": "chatgpt",          // "apikey" routes to the openai provider instead
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": null,          // a string only in apikey mode
  "tokens": {
    "id_token":      "<JWT>",
    "access_token":  "<JWT>",      // bearer sent upstream; carries exp + account claim
    "refresh_token": "<JWT>",      // used to mint a new access token
    "account_id":    "<uuid>"      // preferred account-id source
  },
  "last_refresh": "2026-07-11T09:00:00Z"
}
```

- **`auth_mode` spelling** — the Codex CLI serializes its `AuthMode` enum with
  `rename_all = "lowercase"`, so a current `codex login` writes `"chatgpt"` and an API-key
  login (`printenv OPENAI_API_KEY | codex login --with-api-key`) writes `"apikey"`. Older Codex
  versions wrote `"ChatGPT"` / `"ApiKey"`. shunt
  compares this field **case-insensitively** everywhere it reads it (`import_auth`,
  `read_openai_api_key`, credential observation), so either spelling is accepted.
- **Account id** — shunt prefers `tokens.account_id`; if absent it decodes the `access_token`
  JWT payload and reads `["https://api.openai.com/auth"].chatgpt_account_id`. If neither exists
  the request fails with `ChatGPT account id missing; run codex login`.
- **Expiry** — there is no `expires_at` field. shunt reads the `exp` claim from the
  `access_token` JWT and treats the token as expired **5 minutes early** (`EXPIRY_BUFFER`), so a
  request in flight never races the expiry.

### 4.3 Read / refresh / write-back cycle

On every routed request (`get_valid_chatgpt`, `src/auth/codex_auth.rs`):

1. **Read fresh** from the auth file — the Codex CLI may have refreshed it under shunt, so
   re-reading avoids a redundant refresh and a clobber.
2. If the access token is valid (`now < exp − 5min`), use it as-is.
3. Otherwise **re-read once more** (a concurrent `codex` process may have just refreshed it), and
   only if still expired, refresh:
   - `POST https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token`, form-encoded:
     `grant_type=refresh_token`, `refresh_token=<current>`,
     `client_id=app_EMoamEEZ73f0CkXaXp7hrann`.
   - The response yields a new `access_token`, and possibly a rotated `refresh_token` and
     `id_token`.
4. **Write back atomically**: re-read the file, update `tokens.{access_token, refresh_token,
   id_token}`, recompute `account_id` from the new access token, set `last_refresh`, and
   **preserve every other field** (`auth_mode`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and any unknown keys the Codex
   CLI owns). The write goes to a private temp file (`0600`, created exclusively) and is renamed
   into place, so tokens are never briefly world-readable.

You don't configure any of this — it is automatic. The only knob is the file path (§4.1).

### 4.4 Headers shunt sends upstream

For a Codex request shunt sends the Codex-CLI identity so client-version gating (§5) passes
(`src/adapters/responses/request.rs`):

| Header | Value |
| :-- | :-- |
| `authorization` | `Bearer <access_token>` |
| `chatgpt-account-id` | `<account_id>` |
| `originator` | `codex_cli_rs` |
| `user-agent` | `codex_cli_rs/0.153.3` (`CODEX_USER_AGENT`) |
| `version` | `0.153.3` (`CODEX_CLIENT_VERSION`) |
| `x-codex-routing-hint` | `model=<upstream_model>`, or `model=<upstream_model>;tier=<service_tier>` when a tier is set — omitted when the model can't be safely put in a header (see below) |
| `OpenAI-Beta` | `responses=experimental` |
| `content-type` | `application/json` |
| `content-encoding` | `zstd` — only when the request body was compressed (see §4.5) |

The `user-agent` / `version` are **pinned to openai/codex rust-v0.153.3**. If a future slug
demands a newer client, bump `CODEX_USER_AGENT` / `CODEX_CLIENT_VERSION` in
`src/adapters/responses/request.rs`.

The identity headers — `chatgpt-account-id`, `originator`, `user-agent`, `version`, and
`x-codex-routing-hint` — are sent **only** on the ChatGPT OAuth arm; an API-key (or any other)
credential on a `responses` provider gets the bearer alone. `OpenAI-Beta` is gated on the provider
flavor instead (withheld for xAI/Grok, sent otherwise), and `content-type` is always sent.

`x-codex-routing-hint` mirrors openai/codex's `X_CODEX_ROUTING_HINT_HEADER`
(`build_routing_hint_header`, codex-rs/core/src/client.rs), which upstream likewise suppresses for
api-key/bearer/aws providers. The `;tier=` segment appears only when the same predicate that
governs the request body's `service_tier` holds — a tier is configured and it isn't the
client-only `"default"` sentinel (§9). The websocket transport (`m7-codex-websocket.md`) sends it
too, as a handshake header; because shunt pools and reuses those connections, a reused socket
carries the hint of the turn that opened it. That matches upstream, which also builds the header
only at connection time — and it is a routing *hint*, not a routing decision.

**The hint is omitted, not an error, when it cannot be built safely.** Unlike upstream codex —
which builds the hint from its own local config — shunt's `<upstream_model>` is client-controlled
on a prefix route or via `default_provider`, where the request's raw `model` string is passed
through unchanged. So shunt sends the header only when the model is a plausible slug: non-empty,
at most 128 bytes, and made up solely of ASCII letters/digits and `-` `_` `.` `:` `/` `+`. Anything
else — a `;`, a `,`, whitespace, a control character — drops the header and the request still goes
out. This is an allowlist rather than a list of banned separators on purpose: shunt does not own
the backend's parser for this header, so a parser splitting on `,` (the standard HTTP list
separator) would read `model=gpt-5,tier=priority` as two fields, and enumerating separators against
a grammar this repo cannot observe is the guard that erodes. Failing by omission also keeps a
malformed client `model` from becoming an upstream send failure, which the Codex account pool would
otherwise charge to the account as a transport cooldown. Each omission logs a `debug`-level line
carrying the reason and the model's length — never the model string itself.

That honesty property covers the headers **shunt builds**. On the inbound Codex passthrough
(§17) the caller's own `x-codex-routing-hint` is relayed verbatim like the rest of its Codex-CLI
headers, and its body is the caller's too — so there is no hint/body divergence for shunt to police
there.

### 4.5 Request-body compression

On the ChatGPT/Codex flavor shunt zstd-compresses the Responses **request** body at level 3 and
announces it with `content-encoding: zstd` — the same wire shape the Codex CLI itself sends
(`codex-rs/http-client/src/request.rs`; issue #285). A long agentic turn re-uploads its whole
history on every request, so this is where the bytes are: the win grows with the conversation.

Gating mirrors codex's own two conditions (`responses_request_compression`: the ChatGPT backend
plus ChatGPT OAuth rather than an API key) as a single flavor check, and adds a per-provider
opt-out:

| Condition | Effect |
| :-- | :-- |
| `Chatgpt` flavor (`auth = "chatgpt_oauth"`) | compressed |
| any other flavor (stock OpenAI, xAI, Grok) | uncompressed — none is verified to accept a compressed request body, and one that rejects it would fail the whole turn |
| `request_compression = false` on the provider | uncompressed |
| body under 1 KiB | uncompressed — the frame overhead can exceed the saving, and the backend takes either form |

The body is prepared **once per turn** (`prepare_body` in `src/adapters/responses/body.rs`; same
discipline as the serialize-once fix in issue #251), so a retry, an account rotation, or a 401
refresh-retry reuses the same bytes instead of re-serializing and re-compressing them. The
single-credential path prepares it once, up front, before its bounded-retry loop; the account-pool
path has no fixed point before its rotation loop, so it prepares the body lazily on first dispatch
and memoizes it for every later attempt. Compression always runs on Tokio's blocking pool under
bounded admission rather than on the async executor: a fresh zstd level-3 encoder costs ~90 µs to
build regardless of body size, so even a 1 KiB body would consume Tokio's whole ~100 µs
blocking-work budget inline, while offloading adds only ~40 µs of latency once per turn (measured —
see `compress_request_body`). A compression failure is **not** fatal: it is logged and the
uncompressed body is sent, which the backend accepts.

The websocket transport (§ `m7-codex-websocket.md`) is unaffected: it sends uncompressed frames, so
request compression does not apply there.

---

## 5. Model slugs

The ChatGPT-account Codex backend only accepts the **slugs your account is currently entitled
to**, and **rejects the `gpt-*-codex` slugs** (e.g. `gpt-5.2-codex`) with a `400`
`"The 'X' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account."` Do **not** invent a
`-codex` model id.

- The authoritative catalog of Codex slugs (and the reasoning levels each accepts) is openai/codex's
  [`codex-rs/models-manager/models.json`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/models-manager/models.json).
- Current listed slugs: **`gpt-6-astra`** (latest), **`gpt-5.6-sol`**, **`gpt-5.6-terra`**,
  **`gpt-5.6-luna`** (frontier), and **`gpt-5.5`** / **`gpt-5.4`** / **`gpt-5.4-mini`** /
  **`gpt-5.2`**. Older accounts may only be entitled to the earlier ones; a **free** account has
  resolved to `gpt-5.5` in testing.
- To see what your account can use, look at what the `codex` CLI itself sends, or the live
  `/models` fetch it performs at startup.

> **Client-version gating.** Some slugs carry a `minimal_client_version` (e.g. `gpt-6-astra`
> needs ≥ 0.153.0). When the request's client identity is missing or too old the backend answers
> **`Model not found <slug>`** — *not* an entitlement error. shunt avoids this by sending the
> pinned Codex CLI headers (§4.4). See [openai/codex#31967](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/31967).

shunt surfaces the backend's own `detail` message on error, so a wrong or unentitled slug returns
the real reason rather than a generic failure.

---

## 6. Routing a model to Codex

A request's `model` id selects the provider. Precedence: matching `[models.upstream_model]` entry
→ exact `[[routes]]` → `[[route_prefixes]]` → `server.default_provider`.

For the inbound Codex Responses endpoint, only the first two **exact** declarations participate.
They must resolve to one compatible `kind = "responses"` provider and must not rewrite the model;
an ambiguous map, translated/non-Responses provider, or exact alias that requires rewriting is
rejected before dispatch. A prefix-only, non-exact, or unmatched model uses the pinned
`[server.codex_endpoint].provider` fallback. The request and response remain opaque, credentials
are resolved for the selected provider, and no provider hop is allowed after output begins.

### 6.1 Exact route

```toml
[[routes]]
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"     # the id Claude Code sends (see §7)
provider = "codex"
# upstream_model = "gpt-5.6-sol"   # optional: rewrite to a different slug upstream
# effort = "high"                  # optional: pin effort for this route (see §8)
```

`upstream_model` lets the id Claude Code sends differ from the slug the backend receives — the
mechanism behind discovery aliases (§7) and a way to swap the real slug without touching your
Claude Code env.

That aliasing remains valid for translated outbound `/v1/messages` traffic, but it is not eligible
for native inbound Responses passthrough: native ingress must forward the client's exact model
bytes unchanged.

### 6.2 Prefix route

Send every `gpt-*` id to Codex with one rule (note: the built-in example config points `gpt-` at
the `openai` provider — change it to `codex` if you want the subscription path):

```toml
[[route_prefixes]]
prefix = "gpt-5.6-"
provider = "codex"
```

---

## 7. Selecting the model in Claude Code

Claude Code's `/model` picker only honors discovery ids that begin with `claude`/`anthropic`, so
a raw `gpt-*` id needs one of two paths (or remap the tier aliases entirely — §7.4). **They don't
overlap** — the split is on the `claude-`/`anthropic-` prefix:

| What | `claude-…` discovery alias | non-`claude-` id (e.g. `gpt-5.6-sol`) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `/v1/models` discovery → `/model` picker | ✅ auto-listed ("From gateway"), many models | ❌ dropped by Claude Code |
| `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` | ❌ not honored | ✅ adds to picker (**one id only**) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` window (§10) | ❌ ignored → 200k default | ✅ applies → real window |

### 7.1 Primary path — `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION`

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION="gpt-5.6-sol"
```

Adds a picker entry whose id skips validation; that id is exactly what shunt routes on, so it
must resolve through a matching `[models.upstream_model]` entry, `[[routes]]`, or
`[[route_prefixes]]` rule. This is the recommended path — it's the only one that also lets you set
an accurate context window (§10).

### 7.2 Discovery alias — a `claude-`-named alias rewritten to a Codex slug

Convenient when you want several Codex models auto-listed in the picker. Expose a `claude-`-named
alias and rewrite it upstream:

```toml
[[models]]
id = "claude-gpt-5.6-sol-via-codex"     # MUST begin with claude/anthropic
display_name = "GPT-5.6-Sol (via Codex)"

[[routes]]
model = "claude-gpt-5.6-sol-via-codex"  # the alias Claude Code sends
provider = "codex"
upstream_model = "gpt-5.6-sol"          # real slug forwarded to the ChatGPT backend
```

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1   # Claude Code v2.1.129+
```

The alias shows in `/model` as *From gateway*. **Trade-off:** because the alias begins with
`claude-`, `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` can't reach it, so its context bar stays pinned at the
200k default (safe, but under-sized). Use `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` when you need the real
window. Discovery also needs a gateway credential set (an API key / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` /
`apiKeyHelper`) — a plain Max/Pro login alone won't trigger the `/v1/models` request. See
[`running.md`](running.md) §5.5 and [`m3-discovery.md`](m3-discovery.md).

### 7.3 Subagents

You can run a subagent on a Codex slug while the main session stays on Claude. The `model:`
frontmatter field is the key: it accepts **any string** (unlike the Agent/Task tool's `model`
parameter, which only takes the built-in aliases `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`/`fable`).

**Point an existing subagent at a Codex slug** — edit its `.claude/agents/<name>.md` frontmatter
and set (or add) `model:`. For example, to move an existing `researcher` agent onto `gpt-5.6-sol`:

```markdown
---
name: researcher
description: Deep research agent.
model: gpt-5.6-sol        # was: sonnet (or absent → inherited)
---

<the agent's system prompt — unchanged>
```

Then spawn it by its type **without** a `model` override — the tool parameter outranks frontmatter,
so passing one would shadow the slug. Resolution order:
`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` > Agent/Task tool `model` > frontmatter `model:` > `inherit`.

**Force every subagent onto one Codex slug** — set the env var (highest precedence, global):

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL="gpt-5.6-sol"
```

Either way the id must resolve through a matching `[models.upstream_model]` entry, `[[routes]]`, or
`[[route_prefixes]]` rule (§6) and, being non-`claude-`, obeys
`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` (§10) — the context
window follows the id automatically, so one global value sizes the mapped subagent while the Claude
main keeps its own.

The **[`shunt-codex` plugin](../plugins/shunt-codex/)** ships ready-made subagents for
`gpt-5.6-sol` / `-terra` / `-luna` (each pins its `model:` frontmatter to the slug), so you can
`@`-mention a Codex model without authoring the agent files yourself.

### 7.4 Remap the tier aliases (`haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus` → Codex)

Instead of adding one custom id, you can repoint Claude Code's **built-in tier aliases** at Codex
slugs, so the whole session's tier system resolves to your ChatGPT subscription
([model-config env vars](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config#environment-variables)):

| Env var | Controls |
| :-- | :-- |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | what the `haiku` alias **and the background/"small-fast" model** resolve to |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | what the `sonnet` alias resolves to |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` | what the `opus` alias resolves to |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL` | what the `fable` alias resolves to |

**Example — the two-tier setup** (`haiku → gpt-5.6-luna`, `sonnet → gpt-5.6-sol`):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL="gpt-5.6-luna"
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL="gpt-5.6-sol"
```

```toml
# shunt.toml — both resolved ids must resolve through routing config
[[routes]]
model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
provider = "codex"

[[routes]]
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
provider = "codex"
```

Now selecting **Sonnet** in `/model` runs `gpt-5.6-sol` via Codex, and every background/haiku task
runs `gpt-5.6-luna`. The resolved id (`gpt-5.6-sol` / `gpt-5.6-luna`) is exactly what shunt routes
on — no `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` needed.

**Nicer picker labels** — the `_NAME` / `_DESCRIPTION` companions take effect on a gateway
(`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` → shunt), so the raw slug isn't shown as-is:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL_NAME="GPT-5.6-Sol"
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL_DESCRIPTION="ChatGPT/Codex Sol via shunt"
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL_NAME="GPT-5.6-Luna"
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL_DESCRIPTION="ChatGPT/Codex Luna via shunt (background tier)"
```

Things to get right:

- **These ids don't start with `claude-`**, so `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` (§10) applies.
  They already send effort without a flag (§8). Handily, `gpt-5.6-sol` and
  `gpt-5.6-luna` are **both 372k**, so one global `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=372000` fits both
  tiers.
- **The `_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES` companion is documented for third-party providers (Bedrock, etc.),
  not confirmed for gateways** — it isn't needed for the effort dial on shunt, since these ids
  already send effort (§8).
- **The haiku tier is Claude Code's background "small-fast" model** (`ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`,
  now deprecated in favor of this alias) — used for cheap, frequent work like conversation
  summaries, titles, and quick classification. Routing it to a full reasoning model like Luna is
  fine, but it spends your ChatGPT quota on that background traffic and can be slower; pick your
  cheapest entitled slug for the haiku tier if that matters.
- **This is global and session-wide.** If an allowlist is in force (`availableModels` /
  `enforceAvailableModels`), an alias can't be redirected to a model outside the list (Claude Code
  enforces this on the tier-alias env vars as of **v2.1.176**).

---

## 8. Reasoning effort

Claude Code's effort level (`/effort`, the `/model` slider, `--effort`, or
`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`) is sent as `output_config.effort`, which shunt maps to the Responses
`reasoning.effort`:

| Claude Code effort | → `reasoning.effort` |
| :-- | :-- |
| `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` | passthrough |
| `max` | passthrough on slugs that accept it (the **gpt-5.6** and **gpt-6** families), else folded to `xhigh` |

`max` folds to `xhigh` unless the upstream slug contains `gpt-5.6` or `gpt-6` (`supports_max_effort`,
`src/model/responses_request.rs`), because `models.json` `supported_reasoning_levels` caps
`gpt-5.5`/`5.4`/`5.2` at `xhigh` while the gpt-5.6 and gpt-6 families accept `max`.

> **Custom gateway ids carry effort on their own.** Verified on the wire against Claude Code v2.1.224: an id like `gpt-5.6-sol` already sends
> `output_config.effort` with `CLAUDE_CODE_ALWAYS_ENABLE_EFFORT` unset, and setting it to `1`
> produces a byte-identical request. The flag applies to non-first-party providers (Bedrock, Vertex,
> Foundry, gateway login).

> What does lose effort: ids on the client's legacy deny list (`claude-sonnet-4-5`,

**Precedence in shunt** (`effort()`, `src/model/responses_request.rs`):

1. A config `route.effort` — or `[providers.codex].effort` — override wins.
2. Else the request's `output_config.effort`.
3. Else `thinking.enabled` → `high`.
4. Else a model-name suffix: `-xhigh` / `-high` / `-medium` / `-low` (with `-spark` treated as
   `-low`).
5. Else `medium`.

So `effort = "high"` under `[providers.codex]` pins high effort for all Codex traffic regardless
of the Claude Code slider; drop it to let the client control effort per-turn.

---

## 9. Fast mode (`service_tier`)

Codex CLI's `/fast` toggle sends the Responses API top-level field `service_tier: "priority"` — a
sibling of `reasoning`, not a model or effort change. It is branded "Fast" (faster responses at
increased usage). shunt exposes the same knob as a config key, at both provider and route level,
exactly parallel to `effort` (§8):

```toml
[providers.codex]
# service_tier = "fast"             # optional: opt in to Codex's "Fast" mode (see below)
```

```toml
[[routes]]
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
provider = "codex"
# service_tier = "priority"         # optional: pin service_tier for this route
```

**Accepted values**: `fast` (legacy alias, normalized to `priority`), `priority`, `flex`, or
`default` (a client-only sentinel — it is never sent on the wire). Any other value fails config
validation at load time. A route-level value wins over the provider-level default, mirroring
`effort`'s precedence: setting a route to `service_tier = "default"` explicitly opts that route
**out** of a provider-level `priority`/`flex` tier, since config validation preserves `default` as
its own sentinel rather than collapsing it to "unset" (which would make it indistinguishable from a
route that never configured `service_tier` at all, and let the provider tier leak through). The
sentinel is stripped only at the point the request is built, so `GET /routes`
([`docs/running.md`](running.md)) can still show an explicit `service_tier = "default"` override
verbatim, distinguishing it from a route that never configured `service_tier`.

**Off by default** — shunt never derives `service_tier` from the request, the model id, or any
other signal; it is sent only when explicitly configured. shunt does not gate `service_tier` on
model capability: it forwards whatever value is configured, and the upstream rejects any value the
target model doesn't support.

**xAI/Grok exception:** the field is withheld for the `xai` and `grok` provider flavors even when
configured — xAI's Responses API 400s on `service_tier`, and the Grok CLI flavor inherits xAI's
request-shaping rules (§6 of [`m6-xai-provider.md`](m6-xai-provider.md)).

---

## 10. Context window & usage display

Claude Code computes the context indicator **locally**: `usage` tokens ÷ the model's window size.

- **Numerator is accurate.** shunt forwards the Responses `usage`, peeling
  `input_tokens_details.cached_tokens` into `cache_read_input_tokens` and
  `input_tokens_details.cache_write_tokens` into `cache_creation_input_tokens` and leaving the
  remainder in `input_tokens` — the Responses `input_tokens` is the whole prompt, and Claude Code
  sums all three, so the split preserves the total. The bar therefore fills correctly as the
  conversation grows. An upstream that doesn't report `cache_write_tokens` leaves
  `cache_creation_input_tokens` at `0`.
- **Denominator defaults to 200k for mapped ids.** Claude Code's `getContextWindowForModel`
  returns `200_000` for any id it doesn't recognize (its accurate per-model lookup only runs when
  the base URL is `api.anthropic.com`). A larger real window (e.g. `gpt-5.6-sol` at 372k) shows a
  conservative, over-reported percentage — harmless except that auto-compact triggers early.

Override the denominator for non-`claude-` ids (verified in Claude Code 2.1.205):

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=372000   # gpt-5.6-sol's real window
```

Caveats:

- **Global** — one value for every non-`claude-` model in the session. Match it to the
  **smallest** real window among your mapped models.
- **Don't set it larger than the real window.** On the streaming path Claude Code uses, an
  overflow surfaces mid-stream as `prompt is too long`; shunt normalizes it
  (`context_overflow_message`, `src/model/responses.rs`) and Claude Code auto-compacts and
  retries — the session recovers, but every overflow round-trip is wasted latency. (Live-verified
  for `gpt-5.6-sol`: 365k answers normally, 372k+ overflows — the boundary is its `models.json`
  `context_window` of 372000; `gpt-5.5` is 272000.)
- A `claude-…-via-codex` **discovery alias ignores this override** (the `claude-` gate) — its
  window stays at 200k. Use a non-`claude-` id for the accurate window.

The `[1m]` id suffix forces a 1M window client-side; shunt strips a trailing `[1m]` before route
matching and before forwarding upstream, so `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]` still routes correctly. Only use it
if the upstream genuinely has a 1M window, or it under-reports.

| Field | Codex (`responses`) model | Claude passthrough |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Context tokens used | ✅ accurate (forwarded by shunt) | ✅ accurate |
| Context window (denominator) | ⚠️ 200k default; set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | ✅ exact |
| `count_tokens` (pre-flight) | ⚠️ local tiktoken or client `char/4` (§11) | ✅ exact (upstream) |
| `rate_limits` (5h / weekly) | ❌ needs Anthropic headers | ✅ shown |

---

## 11. `count_tokens` behavior

The Responses API has no server-side token-count endpoint, so shunt answers Claude Code's
pre-flight `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` itself. Controlled by `count_tokens` under
`[providers.codex]`:

| Value | Behavior |
| :-- | :-- |
| `"tiktoken"` (**default**) | Count locally with the `o200k_base` encoder (the GPT-family tokenizer) and return `{"input_tokens": N}`. Near-exact for text; it can't see the backend's image/tool-schema encoding, reasoning tokens, or cache accounting. |
| `"estimate"` | Return `501 not_supported` so Claude Code falls back to its own estimate. Its `/context` then re-counts every category against Haiku over the network — slow, and silently zero without an Anthropic credential — so this is opt-in. |

```toml
[providers.codex]
count_tokens = "estimate"   # opt out of local tiktoken counting
```

The default (`tiktoken`) is the better choice for most Codex users — it's far closer than Claude
Code's `char/4` fallback and needs no network round-trip. See `src/count_tokens.rs`.

---

## 12. Attribution header

Claude Code prepends an attribution line to the system prompt
(`x-anthropic-billing-header: cc_version=…`). Anthropic strips it; a Codex backend receives it as
the first line of `instructions`. It's harmless but meaningless. To drop it:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_HEADER=0
```

Global — it also removes attribution from any Anthropic-passthrough traffic (used for cost
tracking), which is fine when routing to Codex.

---

## 13. Multi-account pooling

Everything above describes a single `chatgpt_oauth` credential (`~/.codex/auth.json`). The
`codex` provider (or any `chatgpt_oauth` provider) can instead pool several ChatGPT accounts with
session-sticky, quota-aware selection and reactive failover:

```bash
# Log in with the Codex CLI, then import that login into shunt's account store.
codex login
shunt login codex --name main
```

```toml
[[providers.codex.accounts]]
name = "main"   # resolves ~/.shunt/accounts/codex/main.json (override dir: SHUNT_CODEX_ACCOUNTS_DIR)
```

A provider with no `accounts` configured behaves exactly as described above — this is purely
opt-in. See [`m10-codex-multi-account.md`](m10-codex-multi-account.md) for account fields,
cooldown/failover rules, and how this differs from the Anthropic (`claude_oauth`) pool in
[`m8-anthropic-multi-account.md`](m8-anthropic-multi-account.md).

---

## 14. Security

- **Tokens are never logged.** shunt logs only non-secret facts (auth mode, account-id presence,
  expiry, refresh success/failure).
- **File permissions.** On Unix/Linux/macOS any auth file shunt writes is created `0600` via an
  exclusive temp file + atomic rename — tokens are never momentarily world-readable. On non-Unix
  platforms the temp file is written with `fs::write` (no `0600` or exclusive-create guarantee).
- **Treat `~/.codex/auth.json` as sensitive.** It is **not** in `.worktreeinclude`, so it isn't
  copied into Orca worktrees; don't copy it into logs, telemetry, or shared checkouts.
- **The refresh endpoint is OpenAI's own** (`auth.openai.com/oauth/token`) with the public Codex
  CLI `client_id`; shunt sends the refresh token there and nowhere else.

---

## 15. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
| :-- | :-- |
| `authentication_error: ChatGPT auth not found; run codex login` | No `~/.codex/auth.json` (or wrong `$CODEX_AUTH_FILE`). Run `codex login`. |
| `ChatGPT auth tokens missing` / `refresh token missing` | Auth file is in API-key mode (`"auth_mode": "apikey"`) or truncated — that path is the `openai` provider, not `codex`. Re-`codex login` with a ChatGPT account. |
| `400 … not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account` | You used a `gpt-*-codex` slug. Use an entitled non-`-codex` slug (§5). |
| `Model not found <slug>` | Client-version gating or an unentitled slug — not a code error. Confirm the slug via `models.json`; shunt already sends the pinned CLI headers (§4.4). |
| Effort slider seems ignored on a `gpt-*` id | A `route`/`provider` `effort` override is winning, or no effort level is set. `CLAUDE_CODE_ALWAYS_ENABLE_EFFORT` is not the fix — these ids already send effort (§8). |
| Context bar over-reports / compacts early | Set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` to the real window (§10). A discovery alias can't take it — use a non-`claude-` id. |
| `prompt is too long` churn mid-session | `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` is set larger than the real window. Lower it to the smallest mapped window. |
| `gpt-*` model never appears in `/model` | Discovery drops non-`claude-` ids. Use `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` (§7.1) or a `claude-`-named discovery alias (§7.2). |

Validate config before running: `cargo run -- check` (or `./target/release/shunt check`).

## 16. End-to-end example

`shunt.toml`:

```toml
[server]
bind = "127.0.0.1:3001"
default_provider = "anthropic"

# codex is built in; this table only pins a default effort and keeps local counting.
[providers.codex]
effort = "high"
# service_tier = "fast"       # optional: opt in to Codex's "Fast" mode (see §9)
# count_tokens = "tiktoken"   # default

[[routes]]
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
provider = "codex"
```

Shell (the environment shunt and Claude Code run in):

```bash
# One-time: log in so ~/.codex/auth.json exists
codex login

# Run the gateway
./target/release/shunt run

# In the Claude Code environment
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001
export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION="gpt-5.6-sol"   # add gpt-5.6-sol to the picker
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=372000         # gpt-5.6-sol's real window
```

Then pick **gpt-5.6-sol** from `/model`. Everything else in the session still flows to Anthropic
unchanged; only the mapped model's inference is answered by your ChatGPT/Codex subscription.

---

## 17. Inbound Codex endpoint (point the Codex CLI at shunt)

Everything above routes **Claude Code** to a Codex/ChatGPT backend. shunt can also run the
opposite direction: an opt-in **inbound** OpenAI Responses endpoint that lets the **Codex CLI**
itself point its `base_url` at shunt and be load-balanced across a ChatGPT/Codex OAuth account
pool. Unlike every path above, the request is **not** translated to or from Anthropic Messages —
it is a raw Responses-to-Responses passthrough. Full behavior spec:
[`m11-inbound-codex-endpoint.md`](m11-inbound-codex-endpoint.md).

### 17.1 Enable it

```toml
[server.codex_endpoint]
provider = "codex"   # default; must be a chatgpt_oauth provider (e.g. the built-in codex)
```

Absent ⇒ none of the Codex-specific routes exist. Present ⇒ shunt registers three inference
routes at boot — `POST /backend-api/codex/responses`, `POST /responses`, `POST /v1/responses` — all
served by the named provider's account pool, plus `GET /models` and `GET
/backend-api/codex/models` model-catalog aliases. Codex catalog requests receive the valid empty
fallback `{"models":[]}` rather than fabricated partial model rows. The shared `GET /v1/models`
also returns this Codex shape when its query contains `client_version`; otherwise its Anthropic
discovery bytes are unchanged. These catalog variants use the existing model-discovery auth gate.
Config validation rejects an unknown provider or one not using `auth = "chatgpt_oauth"` at
startup.

### 17.2 Point the Codex CLI at shunt

Two `~/.codex/config.toml` shapes work, depending on which base URL the CLI appends `/responses`
to:

```toml
# Option A: mirror the ChatGPT backend's base URL
chatgpt_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/backend-api/codex"
```

```toml
# Option B: a custom model provider (selected via the top-level model_provider)
model_provider = "shunt"

[model_providers.shunt]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
```

If shunt has `[server.auth]` configured (recommended for anything beyond loopback), present the
client token **either** way — shunt accepts both (`InboundAuth::authenticate_bearer`):

**Option A:** OpenAI-style Bearer key (the LiteLLM/llmgateway idiom), on the built-in openai provider. Set the base URL in `~/.codex/config.toml` — **NOT** via the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env var, which does not redirect the CLI's Responses WebSocket transport (the CLI keeps hitting `wss://api.openai.com` and bypasses shunt):

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
openai_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/v1"
```

```bash
# then present only the token via env — Codex sends it as Authorization: Bearer
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<shunt-token>"
```

**Option B:** the `x-shunt-token` header — only a custom provider can attach one:

```toml
[model_providers.shunt]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
env_key = "SHUNT_TOKEN"                            # option A on a custom provider: Bearer from $SHUNT_TOKEN
# http_headers = { "x-shunt-token" = "<token>" }   # option B: the header form
```

The Codex CLI's own local `~/.codex/auth.json` login is irrelevant once pointed at shunt this
way — the account comes from shunt's pool, not the CLI.

### 17.3 Account provisioning

Reuses the same pool as §13 — the target provider's `[[accounts]]` (or the auto-discovered account
store). Import a Codex CLI login the same way:

```bash
codex login
shunt login codex --name main
```

With no `[[providers.codex.accounts]]` configured **and an empty account store**, the endpoint falls
back to the single default `~/.codex/auth.json` credential (no pooling, no failover) — it works out
of the box for a single account. (The handler first scans the account store and pools any
auto-discovered accounts, so imported store logins still get pooling.)

### 17.4 What's different from the outbound path

- No model-based routing — every inbound request goes to the one configured provider, regardless
  of the `model` field in the body.
- **Verbatim header passthrough.** The outbound path *synthesizes* the Codex identity headers of
  §4.4 (pinned `originator`/`user-agent=codex_cli_rs/0.153.3`/`version=0.153.3`, `OpenAI-Beta`, session
  headers). The inbound endpoint does **not** — the client already *is* a Codex CLI, so its own
  request headers (`version`, `originator`, `OpenAI-Beta`, `x-codex-*`, …) are forwarded unchanged
  and shunt swaps in **only** the pool account's `Authorization` + `chatgpt-account-id` (and strips
  the `x-shunt-token` header, plus `x-api-key` unconditionally — the target provider is validated
  `chatgpt_oauth`-only, so no inbound `x-api-key` value can ever be a valid upstream credential).
  So the client's real `version` — not shunt's pinned one — drives the
  backend's `minimal_client_version` gating (§5).
- On pool exhaustion, the last upstream response is relayed **verbatim** rather than re-shaped
  into an Anthropic-style error — the opposite of §13's outbound Codex pool, which re-shapes the
  last response into an Anthropic error envelope (`build_upstream_error`).
- HTTP/SSE only, even if the target provider has `websocket = true`.

See [`m11-inbound-codex-endpoint.md`](m11-inbound-codex-endpoint.md) for the full spec, including
the exact failover/cooldown table and reload semantics.
