# shunt vs. other Claude Code gateways & LLM proxies

A grounded comparison of `shunt` against the tools it sits closest to. The goal is
to make shunt's design boundaries explicit: what it deliberately does *not* do, and
where the real, in-scope improvement opportunities are.

> Scope note: claims about shunt cite `file:line` in this repo. Claims about
> CLIProxyAPI were verified against `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI@main`. Claims about
> general gateways (LiteLLM/Portkey/bifrost) are kept at the level the projects
> themselves advertise and match shunt's own README "Related work" framing.

## 1. What shunt is (and isn't)

shunt is a **spec-compliant Claude Code LLM gateway**: it implements Claude Code's
official `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` gateway contract (`/v1/messages`, `/v1/models`
discovery, attribution/header pass-through) and does **selective, per-`model`-id**
diversion — keep the main session on Claude, divert only the models you name onto
another provider (ChatGPT/Codex, OpenAI, Cursor, xAI, Grok). It translates Anthropic Messages ⇄
the OpenAI Responses API for mapped models, and passes everything else through to
Anthropic unchanged. Routing is purely by the request's `model` id — no
prompt-shape fingerprinting (`README.md:104-131`).

That focus is the axis every comparison below turns on. shunt optimizes for
**translation fidelity and Claude-Code-native behavior**, with Anthropic and
ChatGPT/Codex OAuth account pools that combine model-aware proactive quota rotation
with reactive failover rather than broad multi-tenant fleet operation.

## 2. The peer groups

| Group | Examples | Relationship to shunt |
|---|---|---|
| **Subscription-backed CC proxy (same class)** | **raine/claude-code-proxy** | **Closest peer overall** — Rust single binary, per-`model` routing, Codex WebSocket + `previous_response_id` continuation, 4 subscription-OAuth backends (Codex/Kimi/Grok/Cursor) |
| **Broad Claude-Code proxy w/ Codex OAuth** | **CLIProxyAPI** (router-for-me) | Closest *broad* peer — overlaps on Codex/ChatGPT OAuth, Codex WebSocket v2, tool translation |
| **Narrow Claude Code → Codex swap** | insightflo/chatgpt-codex-proxy | Same inference-layer swap, single backend |
| **General Claude-Code routers** | musistudio/claude-code-router, 1rgs/claude-code-proxy, fuergaosi233/claude-code-proxy | Usually a *global* model swap, not per-model diversion |
| **General AI gateways** | LiteLLM, Portkey, bifrost, modelgate | Adjacent infra — possible *backends*, not Claude-Code-native |

¹ shunt: three adapter *kinds* (`anthropic` passthrough, `responses` translation, and
`cursor` ConnectRPC/protobuf translation — `src/config.rs:395-408`) with 6 built-in providers
seeded by default (Anthropic, OpenAI, ChatGPT/Codex, Cursor, and xAI Grok on two surfaces —
`xai` API-key and `grok` subscription-OAuth — `src/config.rs:652-716`); any other
Anthropic-Messages or OpenAI-Responses endpoint is config-only.
² CLIProxyAPI: aistudio, antigravity, claude, codex, codex-ws, gemini, gemini-vertex,
kimi, openai-compat, xai, xai-ws.
³ raine/ccp routes by `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` per-model like shunt, but has **no
Anthropic-passthrough adapter** — an unknown model id returns 400, so you cannot keep
the main session on Claude while diverting only the models you name.
⁴ raine/ccp implements its **own** ChatGPT OAuth (PKCE browser + device-code login);
shunt reuses the Codex CLI login (`~/.codex/auth.json`) and its own PKCE flow is an
open TODO (`src/auth/mod.rs:19-20`).
⁵ **Confirmed by reading raine/ccp source** (`fe80a6b`, 2026-07-11): no tool-search
handling exists (zero matches for `defer_loading` / `tool_reference` / `tool_search` /
`advanced-tool-use`). Tools are whitelist-rebuilt to `{name, description, parameters}`
(`src/providers/codex/translate/request.rs:476-494`), so `defer_loading:true` is
silently dropped — no 400, but no context saved; a `tool_reference` block in a
ToolSearch result renders as `[unsupported content block omitted: tool_reference]`
(`request.rs:836-842`) rather than the full schema shunt renders for a known
reference (`src/model/responses_request.rs:623-643`) — shunt's `"Loaded tool: X"`
is only the fallback for an unrecognized reference. Hence ○ (vs shunt's ◐):
force-enabling `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` against raine/ccp degrades the discovery-loop
result to a placeholder. By default Claude Code's own gate keeps tool
search off behind a non-first-party base URL, so this stays latent.
⁶ raine/ccp subscription backends: Codex (ChatGPT Plus/Pro), Kimi (kimi.com), Grok
(grok.com), Cursor Agent — all via subscription OAuth.
⁷ shunt pools explicit accounts for both Anthropic `claude_oauth` and ChatGPT/Codex
`chatgpt_oauth`. The Anthropic pool is proactive **and** reactive: session-sticky
selection, per-provider round-robin, model-aware proactive rotation from per-account
5h/7d quota headers, cooldowns, forced refresh after 401, and reactive failover on
quota-rejected 429s and 5xx responses (`docs/m8-anthropic-multi-account.md`). The
Codex/ChatGPT pool (`docs/m10-codex-multi-account.md`) mirrors both halves since
issue #195 — session-sticky/round-robin selection, cooldowns, forced refresh after
401, rotation on 429/5xx/credential-resolution failure, plus proactive near-quota
rotation and burn-rate-aware ordering fed by the backend's `x-codex-*` 5h/7d
windows. This is quota-aware scheduling and quota visibility, not per-request
token usage or cost accounting.
⁸ **[#82]** adds a per-provider `tool_search` flag
(`src/config.rs:1136-1154,2811-2850`) that maps Claude Code's tool search onto
the OpenAI Responses API's own native, client-executed `tool_search` protocol
— `ToolSearch` → `tool_search`, its `tool_use` → `tool_search_call`, and
`tool_reference` → a `tool_search_output` item carrying the loaded tools' full
schemas as structured JSON (`src/model/responses_request.rs`) — instead of
folding schema into text. **Auto by default, narrowed to known hosts (issue
#289)**: the shim invalidates the cached prompt prefix on every reveal (it
must add each revealed tool back into the `tools` array, which shunt
re-derives from client history each turn), so the unset ("auto") default
takes the native, append-only-`input` path only for a host already verified
to implement `tool_search` items — the ChatGPT/Codex backend and
`api.openai.com` — routing to a gpt-5.4+ model; every other OpenAI-compatible
endpoint (LiteLLM, vLLM, OpenRouter, a self-hosted proxy, ...) keeps the shim
unless the operator sets `tool_search = true` after confirming it implements
the protocol, since most third-party Responses backends don't and would
otherwise fail the turn instead of degrading gracefully. The native shapes
were live-probe verified against the ChatGPT/Codex backend on gpt-5.6
(2026-07-13, [#86]); `tool_search` is documented on the public OpenAI
Responses API for gpt-5.4+ models. xAI/Grok routes and gpt-5.2-and-below
models keep the #43 shim regardless — silently, never an error. Set
`tool_search = false` to force the shim on a provider that would otherwise
take the native path.

⁹ **[#77]** adds an opt-in `[server.admin]` browser surface, registered only when the
`[server.admin]` table is present (`src/server.rs:117-118`, `src/admin/mod.rs:87-103`). It
provisions Anthropic `claude_oauth` accounts (add/list/replace/remove) through the existing
`claude_login` flow and renders a **read-only account-pool dashboard** — per-account 5h/7d
quota utilization and cooldown for Anthropic and ChatGPT/Codex accounts, plus near-quota
flags for the quota-aware Anthropic pool (`src/accounts.rs`). Account provisioning remains
Anthropic-only; the dashboard does not provide request/token usage or cost accounting — well
short of CLIProxyAPI's full management API + quota/usage manager.

## 4. Where shunt leads

- **Claude-Code-native fidelity.** shunt implements the *official* gateway contract
  instead of the "hash the subagent system prompt" heuristic older CC proxies use;
  the session stays inside Claude Code's harness (same tool loop, skills, script
  paths) — only token generation is outsourced (`README.md:97-131`). Most general
  routers and gateways are OpenAI-chat-completions-centric and don't honor Claude
  Code's discovery/attribution surface.

- **Upload trimming on the *translation* path.** Because shunt translates
  Anthropic ⇄ Responses (Claude Code never sends `previous_response_id`), it
  *synthesizes* continuation: it stores the transcript on the pooled connection,
  diffs the next request against it with type-aware normalization, and injects
  `previous_response_id` + input-delta — real upload trimming on the Claude→Codex
  path (`src/adapters/responses/codex_continuation.rs`). This is **not** unique:
  **raine/claude-code-proxy does the same class of thing** (opt-in
  `CCP_CODEX_PREVIOUS_RESPONSE_ID`, session-keyed, append-only). The two Rust
  subscription proxies share it — the real contrast is with **passthrough** proxies
  like **CLIProxyAPI**, whose Codex WS stores no transcript/response-id, relies on
  the Codex CLI client to send `previous_response_id`, and therefore re-sends full
  input every turn on *its* translation path (plus a tool-output "repair" cache to
  keep tool-call pairing consistent).

- **Normalization depth + reasoning fidelity (vs the nearest peer).** Within that
  shared-continuation pair, shunt goes further than raine/claude-code-proxy on two
  axes: (1) its continuation normalization parses `function_call.arguments` and
  round-trips reasoning `encrypted_content`/signature, so continuation keeps firing
  across tool turns where a shape-only comparison would drop it
  (`src/adapters/responses/codex_continuation.rs`); and (2) it **forwards Codex reasoning
  to Claude Code as `thinking`**, whereas raine/claude-code-proxy **drops Codex
  reasoning blocks entirely** (its README lists this as a limitation). Any unforeseen
  shape still falls back to full input — never wrong context, only a missed
  optimization.

- **Small, auditable footprint.** Single Rust binary, TOML+env config with
  fail-closed boot validation and hot-reload; no runtime plugin surface to secure.

## 5. Where shunt trails — and why

Most gaps are **deliberate scope boundaries**, not oversights. shunt's own README
positions general gateways (LiteLLM/Portkey/bifrost) as *adjacent infrastructure /
possible backends*, not the same product.

- **Multi-account pooling is deliberately narrow.** shunt has a proactive and reactive
  account pool for `auth = "claude_oauth"`: `x-claude-code-session-id` stickiness,
  per-provider round-robin, model-aware rotation before the 5h or governing weekly
  bucket reaches the wall, account cooldowns, credentials-file force-refresh after
  401, and failover after quota-rejected 429s or 5xx responses
  (`docs/m8-anthropic-multi-account.md`). ChatGPT/Codex (`auth = "chatgpt_oauth"`) now
  has a mirrored pool with **both halves**: session-sticky/round-robin selection,
  cooldowns, and failover on 401/429/5xx/credential-resolution failure, plus
  quota-aware proactive rotation fed by the backend's `x-codex-*` rate-limit
  headers (`docs/m10-codex-multi-account.md`, issue #195). Both pools can also ramp
  concurrency on a freshly switched account (opt-in `ramp_initial_concurrency`
  storm control), and the admin dashboard exposes per-account usage.
  CLIProxyAPI, LiteLLM, and Portkey provide broader fleet-oriented balancing and
  visibility, and CLIProxyAPI in particular supports quota-aware fill-first ordering
  that shunt's Codex pool still lacks; see §6, item H for the remaining gap.
- **Narrow backend breadth.** Only Anthropic-Messages passthrough or OpenAI-Responses
  translation; no native Gemini/Bedrock/Azure/Ollama unless they expose one of those
  two protocols.
- **Narrow, opt-in management surface; no full management API, per-request usage
  accounting, or cost tracking.** The always-on endpoints are just `/`, `/health`,
  `/protocol`, `/v1/models`, `/routes`, `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens`
  (`src/server.rs:106-112`). An opt-in `[server.admin]` surface ([#77]) adds
  browser-based Anthropic-account provisioning and a **read-only account-pool
  dashboard** (`src/admin/mod.rs:87-103`). A separate opt-in `[server.usage]`
  endpoint exposes only an authenticated aggregate of pool quota windows, with no
  account identities or per-account numbers. There is still no general management
  API, per-request usage accounting, or cost tracking; observability beyond that is
  opt-in Sentry metrics only (`src/metrics.rs`). CLIProxyAPI ships a full management
  API + quota/usage manager and a third-party dashboard ecosystem;
  raine/claude-code-proxy ships a built-in **monitor TUI** (live sessions, active /
  recent requests, error events) — a live-traffic view shunt's account-oriented
  dashboard doesn't replace.
- **No own ChatGPT OAuth login.** shunt reuses the Codex CLI login
  (`~/.codex/auth.json`); a first-party PKCE flow is an open TODO
  (`src/auth/mod.rs:19-20`). raine/claude-code-proxy is prior art here — it ships its
  own `codex auth login` (PKCE) **and** `codex auth device` (device-code), so it works
  without the Codex CLI installed.
- **No plugin / interceptor system.** The adapter set is a fixed three-variant `match`
  (`src/proxy.rs:170-186`); CLIProxyAPI has a full plugin host (RPC ABI, auth
  providers, executor routing, request/response translators).
- **Plain HTTP only** (TLS out of scope, `docs/m4-inbound-auth.md:13`).

## 6. Improvement opportunities (from this comparison)

Ordered by fit with shunt's mission. **In-scope** items advance high-fidelity
translation / Claude-Code-native behavior; **scope-boundary** items would move shunt
toward being a fleet gateway and warrant a conscious decision first.

### In-scope

- **A. tool-search context savings (already tracked: [#43]).** **Largely
  addressed by [#82]/[#286], narrowed by [#289]**: a per-provider
  `tool_search` flag defaults ("auto") to the Responses API's native,
  client-executed `tool_search` protocol instead of the text shim, but only
  for a host already known to implement it — the ChatGPT/Codex backend and
  `api.openai.com` — routing to a gpt-5.4+ model (see footnote 8 above); any
  other OpenAI-compatible endpoint needs an explicit `tool_search = true`
  opt-in. The remaining gap is the flavors/models/hosts that don't qualify:
  xAI/Grok routes, gpt-5.2-and-below models, and custom OpenAI-compatible
  endpoints that haven't opted in all still fall back to the shim, which
  withholds an unloaded deferred tool from the `tools` array
  (`src/model/responses_request.rs:791-797`) — so it does reclaim context for
  tools never revealed — but once Claude Code reveals a tool, the shim both
  renders its full schema as `tool_reference` text (`:623-643`) *and*
  re-adds the tool to `tools`, so each reveal re-sends the schema and
  invalidates the cached prompt prefix from that point on. The Responses API
  only lets the model call a tool it can see in `tools`, so this double-send
  is unavoidable without the native protocol — the residual gap closes only
  as xAI/Grok and older OpenAI models gain their own `tool_search`-equivalent
  support upstream, or as more custom endpoints are verified and opted in.

- **B. Codex WS: live-probe the continuation normalization (already tracked: [#45]).** **Done (2026-07-13).**
  Reasoning/`function_call` normalization was schema-validated against 3 sources; a live probe over the
  WebSocket transport then captured real `message`/`reasoning`/`function_call` output items and diffed
  them against `normalize_item` — **no unaccounted field**. The probe corrected two assumptions: the
  backend omits reasoning `status` and returns an empty plaintext `content` array under `store:false`
  (both already stripped, so the match is unaffected). End-to-end, all three item kinds continued from
  `previous_response_id` on a warm pool (delta-only turns, zero `previous_response_not_found` rejects).
  A new `shunt.codex_continuation` counter (hit vs full-input fallback) makes future drift visible. The
  one residual is namespaced/MCP tool calls (need a live MCP server to trigger); their `namespace` strip
  stays schema-grounded until probed.

- **C. Codex WS: mid-stream failure fallback (resolved: [#46]).** Two fixes closed
  this. **[#93]** removed one *cause* at checkout: a half-open pooled socket now
  fails the reuse liveness probe (a timely `Pong` is required, not just a local
  write) and is replaced with a fresh handshake before the turn's frame is sent, so
  a stale connection can no longer break mid-stream. **[#46]** then closed the
  residual send→first-event window the checkout probe cannot cover (the socket dies
  *after* the frame is sent, before the first event): `open_ws_turn` peeks the first
  event and `commit_or_fallback` re-drives the turn over HTTP on a pre-first-event
  transport error (`src/adapters/responses/websocket.rs`), extending the pre-handshake
  safety net across that window. A failure *after* the first event has streamed is
  genuinely mid-stream — restarting would duplicate output — so it is surfaced as a
  clean Anthropic `error` SSE event rather than replayed; mid-turn resume via
  `previous_response_id` is a deliberate non-goal (partial output is already
  committed to the client). Covered by `tests/codex_websocket_fallback.rs`.

- **D. Codex WS: speculative prewarm (`generate:false`) (already tracked: [#47]).** Explicitly out of scope
  today (`docs/m7-codex-websocket.md:53-58`), but it is a real Codex latency
  optimization — prewarming the socket/context before the first token. Worth
  revisiting once continuation is live-probed.

- **E. Upstream retry/backoff (done: [#48]; safety-gated: [#126]).** The M4-planned bounded retry/backoff
  now ships as a reusable `src/retry.rs` layer shared by the Anthropic, Responses, and Cursor
  single-credential paths, strictly pre-stream, with exponential backoff + randomized jitter, honoring
  `Retry-After` in both its delta-seconds and HTTP-date forms (giving up cleanly when it exceeds
  budget). It always retries connection errors; a transient status `429`/`502`/`503`/`504`/`529`
  (Anthropic's "Overloaded") is retried only on the idempotent Cursor path, while the non-idempotent
  Anthropic Messages and single-credential Responses POSTs surface it immediately (#126: a response may
  mean the generation was already accepted upstream). It is configurable per provider under
  `[providers.<name>.retry]` (on by default, conservative), held off `count_tokens`, and left off the
  `claude_oauth`/`chatgpt_oauth` account pools, which drive their own account-rotation failover.

### Scope-boundary (decide before doing)

- **G. Minimal multi-account for ChatGPT/Codex — implemented, proactive + reactive.**
  M10 pools a handful of `~/.codex/auth.json`-style logins behind `chatgpt_oauth`
  with session-sticky selection and cooldown-based failover on 401/429/5xx/
  credential-resolution failure (`docs/m10-codex-multi-account.md`). Since issue
  #195 the pool also schedules proactively from the backend's `x-codex-*`
  per-account rate-limit headers — near-quota rotation, burn-rate ordering, and
  `[server.pool]` thresholds, matching the Anthropic (`claude_oauth`) pool's
  proactive-plus-reactive design — and both pools gained opt-in storm control
  (`ramp_initial_concurrency`). Deliberate *fill-first* ordering (preferring the
  most-utilized account to drain windows sequentially) remains unbuilt; shunt
  spreads by headroom instead.

- **H. Per-account quota/usage visibility.** Follows G. For Anthropic accounts the
  opt-in admin dashboard ([#77]) already surfaces each account's 5h/7d window and
  cooldown state (`src/accounts.rs:46-63`); extending the same per-account view to
  ChatGPT/Codex subscription accounts (as CLIProxyAPI's ecosystem does) is the part
  still missing. Ties to the observability gap.

- **I. Native Gemini backend — Implemented (Path B).** Reuses the Google One AI Pro / Code Assist subscription token (`google_oauth`) from the Gemini CLI credential file. Valid access tokens work directly; shunt-side refresh requires operator-supplied Google OAuth client credentials. Supports models like `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` and `gemini-3-flash-preview`.

## 7. One-line takeaway

shunt is the **high-fidelity, Claude-Code-native** end of the spectrum. Its nearest
peer is **raine/claude-code-proxy** — same class (Rust,
subscription OAuth, per-`model` routing, Codex WS + `previous_response_id`
continuation) — against which shunt's edge is deeper continuation normalization,
Codex reasoning fidelity (raine drops it), an Anthropic-passthrough path (keep the
main session on Claude), and xAI OAuth; raine's edge is a built-in monitor TUI, a
first-party ChatGPT OAuth login, and Kimi breadth. Against **CLIProxyAPI**,
shunt wins on translation-path upload trimming (CLIProxyAPI's WS is a passthrough)
and trades away most fleet features (broad multi-account LB, management, plugins,
backend breadth) by design. It now provides a narrow Anthropic OAuth account pool
with model-aware proactive quota scheduling plus reactive failover, and a mirrored
ChatGPT/Codex pool with the same proactive-plus-reactive machinery fed by the
backend's `x-codex-*` rate-limit headers (issue #195); deliberate fill-first
ordering across accounts is the remaining gap (§6, items G–H).
The highest-value in-scope work is finishing the tool-search
context savings ([#43]) — largely addressed by the native `tool_search`
path, auto-enabled by default for known hosts (the ChatGPT/Codex backend and
`api.openai.com`) on Codex/OpenAI ([#82], [#286], [#289]); the residual gap
is xAI/Grok routes, gpt-5.2-and-below models, and un-opted-in custom
endpoints, which still pay the shim's per-reveal cache-invalidation cost
(item A above).
The Codex WS transport's pre-first-event HTTP fallback gap has since been closed
([#46]); its continuation-normalization live-probe ([#45]) remains open.
