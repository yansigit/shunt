title: Inbound Codex Endpoint
description: Point the OpenAI Codex CLI itself at shunt and load-balance it across a ChatGPT/Codex OAuth account pool.
---

Every other guide on this site routes **Claude Code** to another backend. shunt can also run the opposite direction: an opt-in raw OpenAI Responses passthrough that lets the **Codex CLI** point its own `base_url` at shunt and be load-balanced across a ChatGPT/Codex OAuth account pool. It is opt-in: when `[server.codex_endpoint]` is absent, none of those routes are registered and shunt's default HTTP surface is unchanged.

This builds on the same account pool as [Codex Multi-Account](/guides/codex-multi-account/) — selection, cooldowns, and refresh are shared unchanged. See the [M11 behavior specification](https://github.com/pleaseai/shunt/blob/main/docs/m11-inbound-codex-endpoint.md) for the full spec, including the exact failover table and reload semantics.

For the end-to-end setup walkthrough — enabling the endpoint, pointing the Codex CLI at shunt, client auth, account provisioning, and picking an entitled model — follow [Connect the Codex CLI](/guides/connect-codex-cli/). This page focuses on *what the endpoint does*; that guide is the *how to connect* checklist.

## Enable the endpoint

```toml
[server.codex_endpoint]   # all keys optional; default shown
provider = "codex"        # must be a chatgpt_oauth provider
collaboration = false     # opt-in bridge for translated V2 collaboration
```

```bash
shunt check
shunt run
```

Startup validation rejects an unknown `provider` or one that doesn't use `auth = "chatgpt_oauth"` — the endpoint injects the operator's Codex bearer, so only a `chatgpt_oauth` provider qualifies. See the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/#servercodex_endpoint-optional) for every key and default, and [HTTP Endpoints](/reference/endpoints/) for the registered routes.

The opt-in also makes Codex CLI model discovery parseable. `GET /models` and `GET /backend-api/codex/models` return the valid fallback `{"models":[]}`. On the shared `GET /v1/models` path, a `client_version` query field selects that Codex shape even when Anthropic-looking headers are present; without it, the existing Anthropic discovery response is unchanged. These requests pass the normal model-discovery auth gate, and shunt deliberately avoids fabricating incomplete Codex model rows.

## Client analytics sink

The Codex CLI also posts product analytics to the base URL. shunt accepts both paths the CLI can produce:

- `POST /backend-api/codex/analytics-events/events`
- `POST /codex/analytics-events/events`

These routes use the same `[server.auth]` policy as the Responses routes but never forward telemetry upstream, because choosing one pooled account would misattribute the client event to that account. They always return `200 {}` after authentication, including for malformed, unreadable, or oversized bodies.

The payload and event properties are neither logged nor exported. shunt records only the sanitized `event_type` as the `event` attribute on the opt-in `shunt.codex_client_events` counter: names may contain lowercase ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and `-`, up to 64 bytes; invalid names become `other`, and unrecognized batches become `unparsed`. Without Sentry or OpenTelemetry metrics enabled, this is a pure discard sink.

## Point the Codex CLI at shunt

The Codex CLI always appends `/responses` to whatever base URL it uses, so either `~/.codex/config.toml` shape works:

**Mirror the ChatGPT backend's base URL:**

```toml
chatgpt_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/backend-api/codex"
```

**Or a custom model provider** (the top-level `model_provider` must select it, or the CLI keeps its built-in provider):

```toml
model_provider = "shunt"

[model_providers.shunt]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
```

With the custom provider (add `requires_openai_auth = false` so the CLI needs no local login), the Codex CLI's own `~/.codex/auth.json` becomes irrelevant once pointed at shunt — the account comes from shunt's pool on every request. The `chatgpt_base_url` shape instead keeps the CLI in ChatGPT-login mode, so it still needs its local login and works only against an **ungated** endpoint: its ChatGPT bearer is not the configured shunt token, so `[server.auth]` rejects it.

## Client authentication

If shunt has [`[server.auth]`](/guides/shared-gateway/) configured — recommended for anything beyond loopback — present the client token **either** as an OpenAI-style Bearer key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / a custom provider's `env_key`, the LiteLLM/llmgateway idiom) **or** as the `x-shunt-token` header:

```toml
# A. Bearer — built-in openai provider. Set the base URL in ~/.codex/config.toml,
#    NOT via the OPENAI_BASE_URL env var: the env var leaves the CLI's Responses
#    WebSocket pointed at wss://api.openai.com, so it bypasses shunt. See
#    "Point the Codex CLI at shunt" in the connect guide.
openai_base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/v1"
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<shunt-token>"      # sent as Authorization: Bearer
```

```toml
# B. Header — a custom provider carries it (use env_http_headers to keep it out of the file):
[model_providers.shunt]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
http_headers = { "x-shunt-token" = "<token>" }
```

Without `[server.auth]`, the endpoint is open to anyone who can reach it — acceptable for loopback or personal use, not for a shared gateway. The client's presented credential is used **only** to authenticate to shunt: it (and any `Authorization` the CLI happens to send) is stripped and never forwarded upstream. The `[server.admin]` credential header — `x-shunt-admin-token` by default, or whatever `[server.admin] header` names — is stripped too, since the admin surface authenticates on that slot and an admin credential can provision upstream accounts. So is the whole `cookie` header, because the admin surface also accepts a write-tier session cookie there; shunt keeps no cookie jar, so nothing upstream depends on it. `x-api-key` is stripped unconditionally too — even when `[server.auth]` is not configured — since the target provider is validated `chatgpt_oauth`-only at boot, so no inbound `x-api-key` value can ever be a valid upstream credential; a client whose `apiKeyHelper` sets both `Authorization` and `x-api-key` to the same key (as Claude Code's does) does not leak that key through the second slot. Because the inbound client is a real Codex CLI, the passthrough forwards its request headers verbatim (`version`, `originator`, `OpenAI-Beta`, `x-codex-*`, …) and swaps in **only** the selected pool account's `Authorization` bearer + `chatgpt-account-id`. See [Connect the Codex CLI](/guides/connect-codex-cli/#3-present-the-shunt-client-token-when-serverauth-is-set) for the full auth walkthrough.

## WebSocket transport

The three Responses paths accept both HTTP `POST` and authenticated WebSocket `GET` upgrades. Authentication completes before `101 Switching Protocols`. On a socket, `generate: false` warmups complete locally; live `response.create` frames reuse the HTTP account pool, force upstream streaming, and forward each SSE `data:` payload as a WebSocket text frame through the first terminal event. Replacing a turn or closing the socket cancels the active upstream body. Client frames and SSE events are limited to 4 MiB, sends apply bounded backpressure, and protocol/upstream failures use standalone `type: "error"` frames with only safe response metadata.

## Account provisioning

Reuses the same pool as [Codex Multi-Account](/guides/codex-multi-account/#configure-the-pool):

```bash
codex login
shunt login codex --name main
```

```toml
[[providers.codex.accounts]]
name = "main"
```

With no `[[providers.codex.accounts]]` configured **and an empty shunt account store**, the endpoint falls back to the single default `~/.codex/auth.json` credential — no pooling, no failover — so a single Codex login works the moment `[server.codex_endpoint]` is set. (The handler first scans the account store and pools any accounts it discovers, so imported store accounts still enable pooling.)

## Route models to other upstreams

By default every request goes to the one provider named in `[server.codex_endpoint]`. An optional `[[server.codex_endpoint.routes]]` table lets the Codex CLI pick a **different** Responses-compatible upstream by model id; every model with no route keeps the fixed-provider behavior.

Several vendors document a native Responses endpoint for the Codex CLI: Z.ai GLM (`https://api.z.ai/api/v1`), DeepSeek (`https://api.deepseek.com`), Kimi Code (`https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1`), MiniMax (`https://api.minimax.io/v1`), Mimo (`https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1`), OpenRouter (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`), Vercel AI Gateway (`https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/codex/v1`), and stock OpenAI. shunt appends `/responses` to a provider's `base_url`, so give it the same base URL the vendor documents for Codex. The upstream must implement the Responses API natively — there is no Responses → Chat Completions adapter.

```toml
[providers.glm]
kind = "responses"
auth = "api_key"
api_key_env = "GLM_API_KEY"
base_url = "https://api.z.ai/api/v1"

[providers.deepseek]
kind = "responses"
auth = "api_key"
api_key_env = "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com"

[server.codex_endpoint]
provider = "codex"

[[server.codex_endpoint.routes]]
model = "glm-5.3"
provider = "glm"

[[server.codex_endpoint.routes]]
model = "deepseek-v4-flash"
provider = "deepseek"
```

`upstream_model` is optional and defaults to `model`; set it when the id the CLI types differs from the id the vendor serves. The routed provider must carry a real credential — a credential-free auth mode (`passthrough` or `none`) is rejected at boot, since the client's own `Authorization` is always stripped. shunt's built-in `kimi` preset is `kind = "anthropic"`, so a Codex route to Kimi Code needs a separate `kind = "responses"` provider — routing a Codex model at the Anthropic-kind preset is rejected at boot.

On the CLI side, point Codex at **shunt** and select the route by `model`:

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
model = "glm-5.3"
model_provider = "shunt"
model_catalog_json = "~/.codex/models.json"

[model_providers.shunt]
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
env_key = "SHUNT_TOKEN"
```

shunt serves no Codex model catalog — its `GET /v1/models` discovery list is Anthropic-shaped and does not advertise Codex routes. The CLI gets slug metadata from a `~/.codex/models.json` catalog referenced by `model_catalog_json`, exactly as these vendors document; only the `model` value selects the shunt route.

What changes for a routed request to a **non-ChatGPT** upstream:

- **Header allowlist.** Only `content-type` and `accept` are taken from the client, plus the resolved credential and whatever identity the routed upstream itself requires — `OpenAI-Beta: responses=experimental` (skipped for xAI/Grok), and the Grok-CLI identity headers for an `xai_oauth` route. No `authorization`, `x-api-key`, `chatgpt-account-id`, `originator`, `version`, `user-agent`, `session-id`, `x-codex-*`, or `x-shunt-*` reaches a third party.
- **Body `model` rewrite.** When `upstream_model` differs from the requested model, shunt rewrites the top-level `model` and leaves every other field intact. A body that is not a JSON object is rejected with a `400` rather than sent on.
- **Identity encoding.** A zstd request body is decoded first — a stock Responses API does not accept that encoding — and `content-encoding` is not forwarded.
- **One credential, no failover.** There is no pool behind a routed third party, so a 429 or 5xx relays verbatim with its `retry-after` instead of triggering rotation.

Matching is exact and case-sensitive with no charset restriction, so vendor slugs like `MiniMax-M3`, `openai/gpt-5.6-sol`, and `~openai/gpt-latest` route as written. A route to another `chatgpt_oauth` provider instead keeps the full pool passthrough. Routes are read from the live config, so they take effect on reload.

## What's different from `/v1/messages`

- **Native routes stay opaque.** For a Responses-native route, the inbound body and upstream response remain byte-for-byte passthrough. Translation is isolated from this path.
- **Compressed request bodies pass through.** Current Codex releases zstd-compress the request body when they talk to the ChatGPT backend, which includes the `chatgpt_base_url` shape pointed at this endpoint. The bytes and their `content-encoding: zstd` header are forwarded unchanged; shunt additionally decodes a copy in-memory only to read the request's `model` for its metrics, logs, and spans. A body shunt cannot decode still relays fine — only the `model` label degrades to `unknown`, with a warning naming the reason.
- **Exact model routing.** A unique exact `[models.upstream_model]` or `[[routes]]` declaration may select one Responses-native or Anthropic Messages provider. Prefix-only, non-exact, and unmatched models use the pinned native `[server.codex_endpoint].provider`; ambiguous declarations reject before any upstream request.
- **Endpoint routes take precedence.** An exact, case-sensitive `[[server.codex_endpoint.routes]]` byte-match may select a credentialed Responses provider and rewrite `upstream_model`. If none matches, the existing exact global resolver (including `[1m]` normalization) and pinned provider fallback apply.
- **Anthropic translation is strict and bounded.** Exact Anthropic routes accept instructions, text and URL/data-URL images, function tools/calls/results, tool choice, generation controls, and reasoning effort. HTTP and WebSocket share one bounded JSON/SSE translator. It maps `end_turn`, `stop_sequence`, and `tool_use` to completed, `max_tokens` to incomplete, and malformed output, unknown stop reasons, stream errors, or premature EOF to failed. Input usage includes cache-read and cache-write tokens.
- **Collaboration is explicit.** `collaboration = true` lets exact Anthropic routes bridge declared V2 `collaboration` tools and plaintext `agent_message` task envelopes. Authorized calls are restored to the collaboration namespace in JSON and SSE responses. Native Responses traffic stays byte-for-byte opaque regardless of the flag.
- **Lossy inputs fail before dispatch.** Translated routes reject `previous_response_id`, encrypted reasoning or compaction state, hosted/custom tools, remote file ids, malformed tool relationships, and unsupported fields instead of guessing. Native Responses passthrough, including compaction V2 triggers, is unaffected.
- **There is no hidden recovery.** Ciphertext-only translated agent tasks fail before credential resolution or network dispatch. shunt never decrypts, caches, persists, or makes a billable recovery request; provide plaintext history or use a native Responses route.
- **Exhaustion relays verbatim.** If every pooled account is tried and at least one upstream response came back, shunt relays that last response unchanged rather than re-shaping it into an Anthropic-style error, since a Responses client expects the raw shape it would have gotten from the real ChatGPT backend.
- **Quota-aware rotation is bounded.** A plain `429` is transient throttling. shunt suppresses an account for a finite internal cooldown only when a bounded response body contains exact structured hard-quota evidence (`usage_limit_exceeded` or `insufficient_quota`); malformed, ambiguous, oversized, or aborted bodies remain unverified. Valid `Retry-After` delta-seconds (including decimals, rounded safely) and HTTP-date values are honored within finite limits. When candidates are exhausted, the final upstream status, body, and safe `Retry-After` metadata remain visible. Account rotation is eligible only before output starts; unrelated route-level failover behavior is unchanged.
- **Compaction stays fail-closed and opaque.** The legacy HTTP-only `POST /v1/responses/compact` forwards body and continuation bytes only to the canonical OpenAI API-key backend. ChatGPT OAuth targets fail locally before credential resolution or network dispatch because that backend no longer serves the separate endpoint. Current Codex compaction V2 sends a trailing `compaction_trigger` through the normal Responses stream, which native routes pass through unchanged. Malformed, ambiguous, translated, or unsupported targets also fail before network dispatch. shunt does not decrypt continuation state, synthesize summaries, or store request history.
- **Gateway-owned errors are OpenAI-shaped.** When the failure is shunt's own — a bad or missing client token (`401`), an unresolvable pool with no upstream response (`502`), an oversized request body, or an unconfigured endpoint — shunt returns it in the OpenAI Responses error shape (`{"error":{"message":…,"type":…,"code":null}}`) with the same status code, so the Codex CLI parses it through its own error path instead of the Anthropic `{"type":"error",…}` envelope. Relayed *upstream* errors (429/4xx/5xx from the backend) still pass through verbatim.
- **Two inbound transports.** HTTP `POST` remains byte-faithful; WebSocket `GET` adds bounded event delivery and does not depend on the provider's outbound `websocket = true` setting.
- **Shared dispatch boundary.** HTTP and WebSocket use the same exact resolver and provider-aware credential filtering. Once output begins, there is no provider hop or replay; only account rotation before output is eligible.

## Security

- Gate this endpoint with `[server.auth]` on anything beyond loopback — the provider injects a real Codex bearer on every request.
- Nothing about the client's own credential reaches the Codex backend; the passthrough forwards the Codex CLI's own request headers verbatim and swaps in only the selected pool account's bearer + `chatgpt-account-id` (the shunt client-token header, the `[server.admin]` credential header, the whole `cookie` header, the internal `x-shunt-inbound-client` label, the client's `Authorization`/`chatgpt-account-id`, and `x-api-key` are all stripped, never forwarded).
- Only the endpoint's **HTTP route registration** is decided once at boot: toggling `[server.codex_endpoint]` on or off at runtime logs a warning that a restart is required to add or drop those paths. Everything the table *contains* hot-reloads — the target `provider` and the whole `[[server.codex_endpoint.routes]]` model table are read from the live config on every request, so adding, editing, or removing a route takes effect on reload.
