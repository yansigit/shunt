---

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `HEAD` | `/` | Liveness probe |
| `GET` | `/` | Human-readable landing (version + endpoint list) |
| `GET` | `/health` | Healthcheck — `{"status":"ok","version":"x.y.z"}` |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | [Model discovery](/guides/model-discovery/) — returns your `[[models]]` entries |
| `GET` | `/routes` | shunt-native route discovery — returns the configured `[[routes]]` table verbatim (model → provider/upstream_model/effort mapping, including claude-prefixed discovery aliases); distinct from `/v1/models`, which serves the narrower Anthropic-protocol discovery response (`id`, `display_name`, and upstream model metadata) |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | Inference — routed per the request's `model` id |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | [Token counting](/guides/effort-and-context/#token-counting-count_tokens) |
| `GET` | `/managed/settings` | Per-user Claude Code managed settings for a gateway JWT; supports `ETag`, `If-None-Match`, and `304 Not Modified` |
| `GET` | `/v1/organizations/spend_limits` | List stored spend caps with directional cursor pagination |
| `POST` | `/v1/organizations/spend_limits` | Create or replace a spend cap for one `(scope, period)` |
| `GET` | `/v1/organizations/spend_limits/{id}` | Fetch one stored spend cap |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/organizations/spend_limits/{id}` | Delete one stored spend cap |
| `POST` | `/v1/metrics` | Inbound OTLP/HTTP metrics from managed Claude Code clients — relayed verbatim to opted-in gateway telemetry destinations |
| `POST` | `/v1/logs` | Inbound OTLP/HTTP log records — relayed only to destinations with `logs = true` |
| `POST` | `/v1/traces` | Inbound OTLP/HTTP spans — relayed only to destinations with `traces = true` |
| `GET` | `/admin` | Admin dashboard (HTML); redirects to `/admin/login` when not signed in |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/admin/login` | Admin-token login form, optional OIDC affordance, and browser-session creation |
| `POST` | `/admin/oidc/start` | Start the optional same-origin admin OIDC/PKCE login |
| `GET` | `/admin/oidc/callback` | Complete OIDC login, enforce the current allowlist, and create the browser session |
| `POST` | `/admin/logout` | Clear the browser session |
| `GET` | `/admin/accounts` | Claude account-store metadata: name, kind, expiry, and UUID; never token material |
| `GET` | `/admin/accounts/codex` | Codex account-store metadata: name, expiry, and ChatGPT account ID; never token material |
| `GET` | `/admin/observed` | Read-only local Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Kimi, Grok, and Cursor identity plus provider-native usage; never returns token material or refreshes source credentials. The Claude row also carries the account `uuid` (null when it cannot be established) so the dashboard can tell an observation and a managed pool account holding the same subscription apart from two different accounts |
| `GET` | `/admin/pool` | Per-`claude_oauth`/`chatgpt_oauth`/`kimi_oauth`-provider managed-pool state; account objects may include an optional `plan` string; a file-derived value can later be refined toward a more precise one via a profile lookup; Codex rows include reported 5h/7d usage (`7d_oi` has no Codex analog); each account also carries a boolean `needs_relogin`: the credential was terminally rejected (`invalid_grant`), carries no refresh token at all, or had a rotated pair lost before it could be stored, so no retry can revive it and only an operator re-login will. It is reported independently of the cooldown fields — a cooldown expires by itself, this does not — and both dashboard tables show it as **needs re-login** rather than the `cooling` a quota pause produces. Memory-only: a restart clears it, and the account's next terminal failure re-establishes it. It is reported even for an account no provider table has ever selected — alongside `has_state: false` — because the admin refresh probe records its verdict by store name. |
| `GET` | `/admin/status` | Observation-only view of [`[server.status]`](/reference/configuration/#serverstatus-optional) polling: each configured source's most recently observed Statuspage indicator, description, incidents, and observed timestamp. Empty `sources` when `[server.status]` is absent or unconfigured — never consulted by routing or failover |
| `POST` | `/admin/accounts/claude` | Start Claude browser provisioning with `{name, mode}` where `mode` is `oauth` or `setup_token` (omitted defaults to `setup_token`); returns `{authorize_url}` |
| `POST` | `/admin/accounts/claude/{name}/complete` | Complete Claude provisioning with `{code}` containing `<code>#<state>`; stores the account and reports whether it is live |
| `POST` | `/admin/accounts/claude/{name}/refresh` | Exercise an **imported** Claude account's refresh grant on demand and report whether the login is still alive. Rate-limited (it reaches the provider token endpoint), and always routed through the shared credential store so it cannot race the proxy's own refresh. Returns the new `expires_at` and never any token material, plus a `needs_relogin` read back from the pool after the probe's own clear — a grant can succeed against an account the pool still considers dead, and the response says so rather than claiming a recovery `/admin/pool` would contradict. Answers `400` for a `setup_token` account (it carries no refresh grant) or any terminal verdict, and `502` for a non-terminal failure |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/accounts/claude/{name}` | Remove the named Claude account's store file |
| `POST` | `/admin/accounts/codex` | Start ChatGPT OAuth with `{name}`; returns `{authorize_url}` |
| `POST` | `/admin/accounts/codex/{name}/complete` | Complete Codex provisioning with `{code}` containing the full localhost redirect URL or `<code>#<state>`; stores the account and reports whether it is live |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/accounts/codex/{name}` | Remove the named Codex account's store file |
| `GET` (WebSocket), `POST` | `/backend-api/codex/responses` | Inbound Codex CLI transport — mirrors the real ChatGPT backend path |
| `GET` (WebSocket), `POST` | `/responses` | Inbound Codex CLI transport — bare `base_url` form |
| `GET` (WebSocket), `POST` | `/v1/responses` | Inbound Codex CLI transport — `/v1`-suffixed `base_url` form |
| `POST` | `/backend-api/codex/analytics-events/events` | Codex CLI analytics sink — accept and discard; record sanitized event-name counters only |
| `POST` | `/codex/analytics-events/events` | Codex CLI analytics sink — root-style `chatgpt_base_url` form |
| `GET` | `/usage` | Client-facing sanitized pool usage — per-window remaining headroom and reset for the shared account pool; never account identity or capacity |
| `GET` | `/api/oauth/usage` | Claude Code CLI's own native usage-bar fetch path — sanitized, Claude-only, routing-aware worst-case pool usage in Anthropic's own wire shape |
| `GET` | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | Gateway OAuth discovery metadata |
| `POST` | `/oauth/device_authorization` | Start a gateway device authorization grant |
| `POST` | `/oauth/token` | Poll a device grant or refresh a gateway session |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/device` | Browser device-code confirmation page and password approval form |
| `POST` | `/device/authorize` | Start OIDC approval after explicit same-origin browser confirmation |
| `GET` | `/device/callback` | Complete the OIDC authorization-code callback |

The gateway discovery, device, token, and browser routes exist only when [`[server.gateway]`](/reference/configuration/#servergateway-optional) is configured at startup. `POST /device/authorize` and `GET /device/callback` additionally require [`[server.gateway.oidc]`](/reference/configuration/#servergatewayoidc-optional); without OIDC configuration they return a browser error page rather than starting an external sign-in. Adding or removing `[server.gateway]` requires a restart because route registration is fixed at boot, while changes to its resolved credentials and OIDC configuration hot-apply.

The `/managed/settings` route exists only when [`[server.gateway]`](/reference/configuration/#servergateway-optional) was enabled at boot. A valid gateway bearer JWT is required; static `[server.auth]` tokens do not authenticate this endpoint. When `[[server.gateway.policies]]` is configured, the response is:

```json
{
  "uuid": "sha256:<stable-user-hash>",
  "checksum": "sha256:<settings-hash>",
  "settings": { "availableModels": ["claude-opus-4-8"] }
}
```

`ETag` is the quoted checksum (`"sha256:<settings-hash>"`). Send it back in `If-None-Match` to receive `304 Not Modified` with an empty body when settings have not changed; comma-separated validator lists, weak validators, `*`, and legacy unquoted checksum values are accepted. No configured `policies` returns `404`; a policy that resolves to an empty document returns `200` with `settings: {}`.

The `POST /v1/{metrics,logs,traces}` telemetry-ingest routes exist only when [`[server.gateway]`](/reference/configuration/#servergateway-optional) was enabled at boot, and require the same gateway bearer JWT as `/managed/settings`. They accept the OTLP/HTTP payloads managed Claude Code clients export — [`[server.gateway.telemetry]`](/reference/configuration/#servergatewaytelemetry-optional) points those exporters at the gateway — and relay the exact request bytes to every destination that opted in to the signal, preserving the inbound `content-type` and `content-encoding` and applying the destination's own configured headers over them (a configured key replaces the forwarded value rather than duplicating the header). The client's `Authorization` header is never forwarded, and relays do not follow redirects. Destinations opt in per signal (`metrics` on by default, `logs` and `traces` off), and a signal with no opted-in destination is accepted and discarded. Relays are detached, so the response is always an immediate `200` regardless of destination health — the success body mirrors the request protocol per OTLP/HTTP (`{}` for `application/json`, an empty `application/x-protobuf` body otherwise); a body over the 32 MiB inbound cap returns `413`.

The spend-limit routes exist only when [`[server.spend]`](/reference/configuration/#serverspend-optional) was configured at boot — independently of `[server.gateway]`, since they authenticate with the [`[server.admin]`](/reference/configuration/#serveradmin-optional) credential. Send that credential in the configured admin header (`x-shunt-admin-token` by default) or in `x-api-key`; both slots are accepted. A write credential (a `write_keys` entry, or a `tokens_env`/`tokens_file` pair) can use every operation, while a `read_keys` credential can use GET only and receives `403` on mutations. `POST` accepts `user` and `organization` scopes, a `daily`/`weekly`/`monthly` period, a `user_id` of 1–256 bytes for user scopes, and an `amount` that is either a 1–19 digit whole-number string of USD cents or `null`. It upserts by `(scope, period)`. List pagination accepts `limit` (1–1000, default 20), `after_id`, `before_id`, and `scope_type`; the two cursors are mutually exclusive. Every response includes `request-id`, and errors use the Anthropic error shape. Caps and mutation audit records persist together in the configured versioned JSON state file, each mutation attributed to `admin-key:<id>` or `admin-token:<name>` — when both slots carry a different credential of the same tier, the configured header is the attributed one. Stage 1 does not expose `/effective` or `/audit` and does not enforce caps on inference requests.

The `/admin*` routes exist only when [`[server.admin]`](/reference/configuration/#serveradmin-optional) is configured; without that table, none of them are registered. They accept the admin credential in the configured header or `x-api-key`, and a `read_keys` credential passes every GET below while being refused with `403` on every mutation and with `401` on `POST /admin/login`. `GET /admin/observed` auto-discovers supported Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Kimi Code, Grok CLI, and Cursor.app credentials on the gateway host. It never refreshes or writes those sources. Claude usage is cached for 60 seconds; Codex usage is response-derived and remains unavailable until traffic through this shunt returns `x-codex-*` headers; the other providers use their first-party read-only quota surfaces. Managed account CRUD and `/admin/pool` remain the separate shunt-owned credential lane.

The `/backend-api/codex/responses`, `/responses`, `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/analytics-events/events`, and `/codex/analytics-events/events` routes exist only when [`[server.codex_endpoint]`](/reference/configuration/#servercodex_endpoint-optional) is configured; without that table, none of them are registered. The three Responses paths serve raw OpenAI Responses HTTP/SSE plus authenticated WebSocket upgrades, unlike the Anthropic-Messages-translating `/v1/messages` above. The two analytics paths use the same inbound-auth policy, never forward or retain the client payload, and return `200 {}` after authentication even for malformed or oversized bodies. Only sanitized event names are counted in `shunt.codex_client_events`; with no metric sink configured they are pure discard sinks. See the [inbound Codex endpoint guide](/guides/inbound-codex-endpoint/).

The `/usage` route exists only when [`[server.usage]`](/reference/configuration/#serverusage-optional) is configured, which itself requires [`[server.auth]`](/guides/shared-gateway/). It authenticates the same client token as `GET /v1/messages` (configured header, `x-api-key`, or `Authorization: Bearer`) and returns a **sanitized, aggregated** view of the shared account pool — per-window remaining headroom and reset time plus a coarse `ok`/`degraded`/`exhausted` status — so a non-admin caller can anticipate throttling. It never exposes account names, counts, priorities, `disabled` flags, thresholds, or per-account numbers; the full per-account detail stays behind admin-only `GET /admin/pool`. A window is `null` only when no non-disabled account reports it. Codex response `x-codex-*` headers and optional `wham/usage` polling populate the observed 5-hour and shared weekly windows; an unobserved window alone is `null`. Codex has no Fable-scoped (`7d_oi`) signal, although another provider in a mixed pool may supply the aggregate Fable window. Response shape:

```json
{
  "pool": {
    "status": "ok",
    "windows": {
      "5h":    { "remaining": 0.42, "resets_at": 1752000000 },
      "7d":    { "remaining": 0.61, "resets_at": 1752500000 },
      "fable": { "remaining": null, "resets_at": null }
    }
  }
}
```

The `/api/oauth/usage` route exists only when [`[server.oauth_usage]`](/reference/configuration/#serveroauth_usage-optional) is configured. It is the exact path the Claude Code CLI's own usage bars fetch (`fetchUtilization`), so when the CLI is pointed at shunt via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, its unmodified UI can show real numbers — **but only for CLIs using a full interactive `claude login` session**; `claude setup-token` and shared-gateway client-token setups were verified not to trigger the CLI's own fetch (see the [M14 behavior specification](https://github.com/pleaseai/shunt/blob/main/docs/m14-oauth-usage-endpoint.md) for the full precondition evidence). Unlike `GET /usage`, auth is bind-topology-gated: unauthenticated on a loopback [`[server]`](/reference/configuration/#server) bind, and requiring a **valid** credential — a configured client token or a valid gateway JWT, exactly as `/v1/messages` is gated — on a non-loopback bind (which itself then requires `[server.auth]` or `[server.gateway]` to be configured). Bare header presence is not accepted. It reports only `claude_oauth`-provider accounts, using a routing-aware, priority-tiered worst case per window rather than `/usage`'s pool-wide least-utilized aggregate — the worst case among the accounts the next request can actually route to, not an optimistic pool-wide minimum. It never exposes account names, counts, priorities, `disabled` flags, thresholds, or per-account numbers. Response shape (Anthropic's own `/api/oauth/usage` schema, `resets_at` in RFC3339):

```json
{
  "five_hour": { "utilization": 42.37, "resets_at": "2026-07-20T23:00:00Z" },
  "seven_day": { "utilization": 61.02, "resets_at": "2026-07-27T00:00:00Z" },
  "limits": [
    {
      "kind": "weekly_scoped",
      "scope": { "model": { "display_name": "Fable" } },
      "percent": 12.5,
      "resets_at": "2026-07-27T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

`five_hour`/`seven_day` are omitted (not `null`) when no non-disabled Claude account reports that window; `limits` is omitted entirely (not an empty array) when no account reports the Fable-scoped window.

`GET /` and `GET /health` stay open even when [`[server.auth]`](/guides/shared-gateway/) is enabled (healthcheck tools usually cannot attach tokens) and expose nothing sensitive — only status, version, and the already-public endpoint list. With `[server.auth]` enabled, `GET /v1/models` requires a valid client token in the configured header, `x-api-key`, or `Authorization: Bearer`; it stays open when inbound auth is not configured. `GET /routes` remains open as shunt-native routing metadata.

## Gateway protocol

shunt implements the official [Claude Code LLM gateway protocol](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway-protocol): correct header and body-field forwarding, feature pass-through, and system-prompt attribution handling. Gateway-owned errors are returned in the Anthropic error shape, upstream context-overflow errors are rewritten to Anthropic's `prompt is too long` wording so Claude Code's [compact-and-retry](/guides/effort-and-context/#context-overflow-recovery) fires, and streaming responses are relayed without buffering (with optional [keepalive pings](/guides/shared-gateway/#sse-keepalive-pings)).
