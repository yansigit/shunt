//! Hot configuration reload for a long-running shared gateway.
//!
//! The live config is held behind an [`arc_swap::ArcSwap`] so a reload swaps in
//! a new [`RuntimeState`] atomically without locking readers. Two triggers call
//! [`reload`]: a `SIGHUP` signal (`kill -HUP <pid>`) and automatic detection of
//! config-file changes (a `notify` watcher on the file's parent directory).
//!
//! Reload is fail-safe: [`reload`] loads and validates the new config in full
//! before swapping, and on any error it returns without touching the live state,
//! so an invalid edit never takes the process down or leaves it running open.
//! Each request snapshots the live state on entry (see `AppState::refreshed`),
//! so an in-flight request never sees config change underneath it.
