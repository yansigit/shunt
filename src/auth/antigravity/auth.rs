//! Antigravity subscription OAuth credential store.
//!
//! Antigravity reaches the same Code Assist backend the `gemini` provider uses
//! — `v1internal` methods on `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` by default,
//! or whatever host the provider's `base_url` configures (see
//! [`AntigravityAuthStore::new`]) — but
//! with its own OAuth client and scopes, and it identifies itself as
//! `ideType: ANTIGRAVITY` during project discovery. The two credentials are
//! therefore not interchangeable, which is why this store exists alongside
//! [`crate::auth::google::auth`] rather than extending it.
//!
//! The credential file (`~/.shunt/antigravity-auth.json`, overridable via
//! `SHUNT_ANTIGRAVITY_AUTH_FILE`) is written by `shunt login antigravity` (see
//! [`super::login`]) and owned solely by shunt. Token values are never logged —
//! only refresh outcomes.
