//! account and changes over time: one account is served
//! `gemini-3.8-flash-tiered` while another is still on
//! `gemini-3.8-flash-{high,medium,low}`. Which form exists decides which model
//! id [`crate::model::antigravity_request::antigravity_upstream_model`] may
//! send, so the catalog — not a compiled-in rule — is the authority.
//!
//! Discovery is best-effort by construction. Every failure path returns the
//! last known good set, or `None`, and the caller falls back to the
//! pre-catalog heuristic: a catalog outage must degrade the id shunt guesses,
//! never fail the operator's request.
