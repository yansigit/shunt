//! Codex Responses WebSocket v2 transport (issue #32).
//!
//! The ChatGPT/Codex backend exposes the Responses API over a WebSocket
//! (`wss://…/codex/responses`) negotiated with the beta protocol header
//! `openai-beta: responses_websockets=2026-02-06`. Real Codex uses it to keep a
//! connection warm across a turn and reuse `previous_response_id`, which trims
//! per-turn upload and dodges the ~372k HTTP request ceiling that silently
//! drops. This module is the transport layer only: it opens the socket, sends a
//! single `response.create` frame, and streams the backend's events back as
//! [`ResponseEvent`]s so the existing [`crate::model::responses::AnthropicSseMachine`]
//! can translate them exactly as it does the HTTP SSE stream.
//!
//! Connections are pooled per `x-claude-code-session-id`, so turns of one
//! conversation reuse an idle live socket instead of re-handshaking. If that
//! socket is already streaming a turn, the concurrent turn opens a dedicated
//! one-shot connection rather than waiting; it deliberately carries no
//! continuation, while the pooled socket keeps the session's continuation state.
//! Each pooled socket is owned by a dedicated reader task that lives for the whole
//! connection (issue #93): it answers upstream `Ping` frames with `Pong` even
//! while the connection sits idle between turns, so the backend never closes it
//! with `keepalive ping timeout`. A turn is dispatched to that reader over a
//! command channel; the reader streams the turn's events, records continuation
//! state on a clean completion, and returns to idle keepalive duty. Turn events
//! cross a bounded channel, applying backpressure when a client falls behind while
//! retaining enough burst capacity for the reader to service interleaved control
//! frames promptly.
//!
//! On a reused connection this module also records the completed turn's response
//! id and output items as [`StoredContinuation`], so the next turn can replay
//! `previous_response_id` and upload only the input delta (the decision itself
//! lives in [`crate::adapters::responses::codex_continuation`]). `previous_response_id` is
//! only ever valid on the exact connection that produced it, which is why the
//! continuation state is stored on the [`Connection`] rather than globally.
