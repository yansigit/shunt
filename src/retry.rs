//! Bounded, idempotent upstream retry with exponential backoff + jitter.
//!
//! [`send_with_retry`] wraps a *single upstream attempt* — the step that
//! obtains the response status and headers (`.send()` on a `reqwest` request, a
//! Cursor connect frame) — and re-issues it on a clearly transient failure. It
//! is deliberately positioned *before* any response body is streamed to the
//! client: the caller only starts relaying bytes downstream after this layer
//! has already returned a response, so a retry can never happen mid-stream. Once
//! a byte reaches the client the request is committed and unrecoverable, which
//! is why this operates on the pre-stream boundary alone (issue #48).
//!
//! Retries are scoped to *transient* outcomes only:
//!
//! - transient statuses `429`, `502`, `503`, `504`, and `529` — Anthropic's
//!   non-standard "Overloaded", a transient signal like the others (never any
//!   other `4xx` — a `400`/`401`/`403`/`404`/`413` is a request problem an
//!   identical retry cannot fix — nor `500`, frequently a deterministic
//!   upstream bug);
//! - connection-level transport errors (connect refused/reset, timeout) that
//!   resolve before any response body exists.
//!
//! Which of those two a call retries depends on [`RetrySafety`] (issue #126).
//! A response *status* is only retried on an *idempotent* call. For a
//! non-idempotent creation POST — Anthropic Messages and the single-credential
//! Responses path, wired as [`RetrySafety::NonIdempotentPost`] — any response
//! status is ambiguous: it means the upstream may already have accepted the
//! request and started a billable generation, so re-issuing could duplicate it.
//! Those paths therefore retry a pre-response *transport* error only and surface
//! a transient status immediately. A transport error carries no such ambiguity
//! (nothing was accepted before it resolved), so it is retried for both
//! safeties. Cursor's `Run` is also a non-idempotent POST but still retries on
//! transient status for now: it has no account-pool failover, so a surfaced
//! blip would hit the client directly, and it has no stable idempotency identity
//! yet — tightening it is tracked inline as `TODO(#126, cursor)`. The shared
//! client configures no response/read timeout, so `is_timeout()` only fires
//! connect-phase (before acceptance); retries are capped by `max_retries`.
//!
//! Backoff is exponential with true randomized (full) jitter, capped at
//! [`RetryPolicy::max_backoff`]. A server-supplied `Retry-After` takes
//! precedence when present; if it asks for a wait longer than `max_backoff`,
//! the attempt is surfaced immediately rather than slept past budget (the
//! `exceeds-budget` behavior). The pooled OAuth failover paths
//! (`forward_claude_oauth` / `forward_chatgpt_oauth`) have their own
//! account-rotation resilience and deliberately do *not* layer this on top; it
//! applies to the single-credential upstream calls that otherwise surface a
//! transient blip straight to the client.
